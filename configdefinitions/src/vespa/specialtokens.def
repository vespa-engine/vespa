## Named lists of special tokens - string which should be
## treated as words no matter what characters they consist of.
## A special token can also optionally be replaced by another
## token.
## 
## Special tokens are case sensitive, since queries and tokens
## are lowercased they should normally be written in lower case.
## 
## The list named default is the only list which is used currently
## 
## Order matters in token lists. If one special token is a
## prefix of another token, Vespa will prefer to return the first
## matching token in the list when encountering the longest
## special token.

## Use 'default' as the name of the list to use in regular
## indexing and queries

## Special tokens, any string is permitted

## The token which should replace the special token
## If no replace is set for a token, the word token
## will be the special token string itself

## Maximum number of hits that will be requested from a single node
## in this dataset. If not set, there is no limit. Using this option
## may help reduce network traffic when searching in datasets with big
## fan-out, but it will also result in incorrect and incomplete results;

## Probability for getting the K best hits (topK).
## A value of 1.0 will ask all N partitions for K hits.
## Any value between <0, 1> will use a Student T with 30 degrees freedom and compute a value Q that
## will give you the globally K best hits according to this formula with the desired probability.
## q = k/n + qT (p',30) x √(k × (1/n) × (1 − 1/n))
## With a probability of 0.999 and K=200 and N=10 will give a Q of 38, meaning that you only need to fetch 19% compared to
## a setting of 1.0. This is a significant optimisation with with very little loss in presicion.

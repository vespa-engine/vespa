## PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS

## Number of threads to use for each mountpoint.
num_threads int default=8 restart

## Number of threads for response processing and delivery
## 0 will give legacy sync behavior.
## Negative number will choose a good number based on # cores.
num_response_threads int default=2 restart

## Number of handler objects that might be created by visitor threads
## This is a temporary setting that only skilled vespa developers should modify
## This must be kept in line with stor-visitor:visitorthreads
num_visitor_threads int default=16 restart

## Number of handler objects that might be created by network threads
## This is a temporary setting that only skilled vespa developers should modify
## This must be kept in line with stor-communicationmanager:rpc.num_network_threads
num_network_threads int default=2 restart

## Type of sequenced thread executor use for persistence replies.
response_sequencer_type enum {LATENCY, THROUGHPUT, ADAPTIVE} default=ADAPTIVE restart

## Chunksize to use while merging buckets between nodes.
##
## Should follow stor-distributormanager:splitsize (16MB).
bucket_merge_chunk_size int default=16772216 restart

## Whether or not to use async message handling when scheduling storage messages from FileStorManager.
##
## When turned on, the calling thread (e.g. FNET network thread when using Storage API RPC)
## gets the next async message to handle (if any) as part of scheduling a storage message.
## This async message is then handled by the calling thread immediately,
## instead of going via a persistence thread.
use_async_message_handling_on_schedule bool default=false restart

## The noise level used when deciding whether a resource usage sample should be reported to the cluster controller.
##
## If one of the resource categories (e.g. disk or memory) has a usage delta that is larger than the noise level,
## the entire resource usage sample is immediately reported to the cluster controller (via host info).
## This config can be live updated (doesn't require restart).
resource_usage_reporter_noise_level double default=0.001

## Specify throttling used for async persistence operations. This throttling takes place
## before operations are dispatched to Proton and serves as a limiter for how many
## operations may be in flight in Proton's internal queues.
##
##  - UNLIMITED is, as it says on the tin, unlimited. Offers no actual throttling, but
##    has near zero overhead and never blocks.
##  - DYNAMIC uses DynamicThrottlePolicy under the hood and will block if the window
##    is full (if a blocking throttler API call is invoked).
##
async_operation_throttler.type enum { UNLIMITED, DYNAMIC } default=DYNAMIC
## Internal throttler tuning parameters that only apply when type == DYNAMIC:
async_operation_throttler.window_size_increment int default=20
async_operation_throttler.window_size_decrement_factor double default=1.2
async_operation_throttler.window_size_backoff double default=0.95
async_operation_throttler.min_window_size int default=20
async_operation_throttler.max_window_size int default=-1 # < 0 implies INT_MAX
async_operation_throttler.resize_rate double default=3.0

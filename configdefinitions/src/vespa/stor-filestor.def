## DETECT FAILURE PARAMETERS

## After seeing given number of errors on a disk, storage will disable the
## disk and restart. If set to 0, storage will never disable disks. Note
## that if you get disk errors, which arent automatically fixed, this will
## make storage keep failing all operations towards this disk, and all
## retries will use the same disk and same file, so you might end up with a
## lot of operations that can never succeed. Thus, it is not recommended to
## turn this off.
fail_disk_after_error_count int default=1 restart

## If a disk operation takes more time in seconds than the disk operation
## timeout, storage will consider that a disk failure, and mark the disk
## bad, restart and not use the disk anymore. Note that currently, this
## includes CPU time too, so if used, this parameter should be set fairly
## high as we still sometimes have some operations that might take a few
## seconds. Disabled by default as we currently have these long operations
## during normal load.
disk_operation_timeout int default=0 restart

## PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS

## Number of threads to use for each mountpoint.
num_threads int default=6 restart

## When merging, if we find more than this number of documents that exist on all
## of the same copies, send a separate apply bucket diff with these entries
## to an optimized merge chain that guarantuees minimum data transfer.
common_merge_chain_optimalization_minimum_size int default=64 restart

## Chunksize to use while merging buckets between nodes.
##
## Default is set to 4 MB - 4k. This is to allow for malloc to waste some bytes
## with tracking info or to align to 512b without passing allocation limit,
## while still reading 4k blocks from disk.
bucket_merge_chunk_size int default=4190208 restart

## When merging, it is possible to send more metadata than needed in order to
## let local nodes in merge decide which entries fits best to add this time
## based on disk location. Toggle this option on to use it. Note that memory
## consumption might increase in a 4.1 to 4.2 upgrade due to this, as 4.1
## dont support to only fill in part of the metadata provided and will always
## fill all.
enable_merge_local_node_choose_docs_optimalization bool default=true restart

## Whether or not to enable the multibit split optimalization. This is useful
## if splitting is expensive, but listing document identifiers is fairly cheap.
## This is true for memfile persistence layer, but not for vespa search.
enable_multibit_split_optimalization bool default=true restart

## If set, causes the service layer to trigger an abort of any queued
## operations for buckets whose ownership changes during a cluster state
## change. This helps ensure consistency between the distributors and
## the storage nodes by discarding operations that were not sent by the
## new owning distributor. The service layer will also block any new
## operations from happening until all operations currently executing for
## buckets with changed ownership have completed.
## Enabling this option has a potential of causing a minor performance
## impact when a node goes up or down due to its blocking semantics, but
## this should be on the order of tens to a few hundred milliseconds.
abort_operations_with_changed_bucket_ownership bool default=true

## If set, aborts any mutating ideal state operations that arrive to a node
## that were scheduled and sent by distributors that no longer own the buckets
## the operations are bound for. This option complements the above config,
## as this is checked for every arriving message and not when the state changes.
abort_outdated_mutating_ideal_state_ops bool default=true

## If set, aborts any external (client) operations that arrive to a node from
## a distributor that is no longer the owner of the bucket those operations
## belong to. As with the abort_outdated_mutating_ideal_state_ops option,
## this is a check that happens whenever a message arrives, not when the state
## changes.
abort_outdated_mutating_external_load_ops bool default=true

## Whether or not to disable partitions when they report I/O errors
fail_partition_on_error bool default=true

## Time period to keep all updates (given in seconds). One can revert any
## operation done within this time.
revert_time_period int default=300

## Minimum number of seconds that document remove (tombstone) entries are
## retained in a bucket before being automatically compacted away. In the case
## where a node has been down for a longer period of time than this value
## and then comes back up, there exists a possibility for documents to be
## resurrected. This happens when documents existing on both the downed node
## and the online nodes are marked as removed on the online nodes and then
## subsequently compacted away along with their remove entries. When the old
## node comes back online, it will appear to the system as if the node has
## documents that do not exist on other nodes (as no remove-entries can be
## found for them) and they will subsequently re-appear.
keep_remove_time_period int default=604800

## For providers supporting multiple document versions, this option specifies
## a soft limit on the maximum number of versions that can be stored for a
## single document at any given time. This is considered a soft limit as it
## is possible for more versions to exist concurrently than what this config
## value specifies in a case where the pressure on the containing bucket is not
## yet high enough to warrant a compaction.
## After a compaction has taken place, only the n _newest_ document versions
## will be present in the compacted representation of the bucket.
## This limitation takes precedence over what versions may be stored according
## to revert_time_period.
## Configured value must be at least 1.
maximum_versions_of_single_document_stored int default=5

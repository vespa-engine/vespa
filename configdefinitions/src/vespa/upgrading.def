## Set to true when there exist nodes of previous major version in cluster.
## This will enable major version backward compability mode in the cluster.

## Set to true when there exist nodes of the next major version in the

## docs. Sometimes though, it may be easier to let old version be forward
## compatable than having new version backwards compatable.

## Set to true when there exist nodes of previous minor version in cluster.
## This should not be needed, but settings exist in case we end up having

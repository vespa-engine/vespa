/**
 * Adds an implementation of a probabilistic frequency sketch that allows for estimating the
 * relative frequency of of elements from a stream of events. That is, the sketch does not
 * capture the _absolute_ frequency of a given element over time.
 *
 * To reduce the requirement for the number of bits used for the sketch's underlying counters,
 * this sketch uses automatic decaying of counter values once the number of recorded samples
 * reaches a certain point (relative to the sketch's size). Decaying divides all counters by 2.
 *
 * The underlying data structure is a Count-Min sketch [0][1] with automatic decaying of
 * counters based on TinyLFU [2].
 *
 * This implementation has certain changes from a "textbook" CM sketch, inspired by the
 * approach used in [3]. In particular, instead of having `d` logical rows each with width `w`
 * that are accessed with hash-derived indexes (and thus likely triggering `d` cache misses
 * for large values of `w`) we subdivide into w/64 blocks each with fixed number d=4 rows of
 * 32 4-bit counters, i.e. each block is exactly 64 bytes. Counter updates or reads always
 * happen within the scope of a single block. We also ensure the block array is allocated with
 * at least a 64-byte alignment. This ensures that a given sketch access will touch exactly 1
 * cache line of the underlying sketch buffer (not counting cache lines occupied by the sketch
 * object itself, as we assume these are already present in the cache).
 * Similarly, comparing the frequency of two elements will always touch at most 2 cache lines.
 *
 * Unlike [3] we use byte-wise counter accesses and only using a single hash computation per
 * distinct sketch lookup instead of explicitly re-mixing hash bits. We also always divide the
 * decay counter by 2 instead of subtracting the number of odd counters found (TODO reconsider?).
 *
 * The Count-Min sketch (and its cousin, the Counting Bloom Filter) using `k` counters is
 * usually described as requiring k pairwise independent hash functions. This implementation
 * assumes this requirement is unnecessary assuming a hash function with good entropy; we
 * instead extract non-overlapping subsets of bits of a single hash value and use these as
 * indices into our data structure components.
 *
 * Important: this frequency sketch _requires_ a good hash function, i.e. high entropy.
 * Use `RelativeFrequencySketch` with HasGoodEntropyHash=false (default) if this is not the
 * case for the type being counted, as it implicitly mixes the hash bits using XXH3.
 *
 * Thread safety: as thread safe as a std::vector.

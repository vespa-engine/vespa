# Testing scalable Highway AArch64 SVE/SVE2 vector kernels

At the time of writing there is no hardware available for SVE2 with wider
vector registers than 128 bits. This makes it tricky to ensure that vector
kernels using `ScalableTag` will work in practice on future hardware.

To get around this, QEMU user mode emulation can be used:

```shell
qemu-aarch64 -cpu max,sve-default-vector-length=$n ./vespalib_hwaccelerated_test_app
```
Where `$n` is the vector width _in bytes_ and should preferably be tested
for all of `16, 32, 64, 128, 256`. SVE/SVE2 tops out at 2048 bits (256 bytes),
so no need to test anything larger.

Example output for 512-bit vector size:
```
$ qemu-aarch64 -cpu max,sve-default-vector-length=64 ./vespalib_hwaccelerated_test_app

  do qemu-aarch64 -cpu max,sve-default-vector-length=$vlen ./vespalib_hwaccelerated_test_app ;
done
```

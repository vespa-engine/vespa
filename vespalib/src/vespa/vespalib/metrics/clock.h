 * Simple interface abstracting both timing and time measurement for
 * threads wanting to do stuff at regular intervals and also knowing
 * at what time stuff was done. The 'next' function blocks until the
 * next tick is due and returns the current number of seconds since
 * epoch. The parameter passed to the 'next' function should be its
 * previous return value, except the first time it is called, then 0
 * should be used. A convenience function called 'first' is added for
 * this purpose.

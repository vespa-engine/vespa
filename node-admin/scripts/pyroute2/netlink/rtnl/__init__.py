RTNetlink: network setup
========================

RTNL is a netlink protocol, used to get and set information
about different network objects -- addresses, routes, interfaces
etc.

RTNL protocol-specific data in messages depends on the object
type. E.g., complete packet with the interface address information::

    nlmsg header:
        + uint32 length
        + uint16 type
        + uint16 flags
        + uint32 sequence number
        + uint32 pid
    ifaddrmsg structure:
        + unsigned char ifa_family
        + unsigned char ifa_prefixlen
        + unsigned char ifa_flags
        + unsigned char ifa_scope
        + uint32 ifa_index
    [ optional NLA tree ]

NLA for this kind of packets can be of type IFA_ADDRESS, IFA_LOCAL
etc. -- please refer to the corresponding source.

Other objects types require different structures, sometimes really
complex. All these structures are described in sources.

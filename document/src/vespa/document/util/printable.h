     * printed.
     *
     * You should be properly indented before calling this function. The indent
     * variable tells you what you need to add after each newline to get
     * indented as far as your first line was. Thus, single line output don't
     * need to worry about indentation.
     *
     * A typical multiline print would thus be something like this:
     * <pre>
     *   out << "MyClass() {\n"
     *       << "\n" << indent << "  some info"

     * @param out The stream to print itself to.
     * @param verbose Whether to print detailed information or not. For instance
     *                a list might print it's size and properties if not verbose
     *                and print each singel element too if verbose.
     * @param indent This indentation should be printed AFTER each newline
     *               printed. (Not before output in first line)

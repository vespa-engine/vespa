# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#

# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.
gem "minima", "~> 2.0"

# kramdown v2 ships without the gfm parser by default. If you're using
# kramdown v1, comment out this line.

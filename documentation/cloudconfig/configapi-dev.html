<p>
This document describes how to use the C++ and Java version of the
Cloud config API, from now on referred to as the 'config API'. See
also the <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/config/package-summary.html">Java</a>
reference.
</p>



<h1 id="developing">Developing with the Config API</h1>

<p>
This page explains how to use the Config API in your application.
</p>

<p>
To develop with the config API, you need to install the
<code>cloudconfig_dev</code> package. To run your application
with the cloud config system, you need to install the
<code>cloudconfig</code> package. This tutorial describes how
you can set up a simple application serving the message of the day,
using cloud config.
</p>


<h2 id="creating-config-definition">Creating a Config Definition</h2>
<p>
The first thing to do when deciding to use the config API is to define
the config you want to use in your application. This is thoroughly
described in the <a href="../reference/config-files.html">configuration
file reference</a>. For the rest of this tutorial, we will use this
definition <code>motd.def</code> from the complete example at the end
of the tutorial.
</p>

<pre>
namespace=myproject

message string default="NO MESSAGE"
port int default=1337
</pre>


<h2 id="generate-source">Generating Source Code and Accessing Config in Code</h2>

<p>
Before you can access config in your program you will need to generate
source code for the config definition. Simple steps for how you can
generate API code and use the API are provided for:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="configapi-dev-cpp.html">C++</a></li>
<li><a href="configapi-dev-java.html">Java</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
We also recommend that you read the <a href="#guidelines">general
guidelines</a> section at the end of this document to get examples of
advanced usage and recommendations for how to incorporate the API in
your code.
</p>


<h2 id="config-id">The Config ID</h2>
<p>
The config id specified when requesting config is essentially an
identifier of the component requesting config. The config server
contains a config object model, which maps a request for a given
config name and config id to the correct configproducer instance,
which will merge default values from the config definition with config
from the object model and config set in
<code>services.xml</code> to produce the final config instance.
</p>

<p>
The config id is given to a service via the VESPA_CONFIG_ID environment
variable. The config sentinel (mentioned <a
href="config-introduction.html#bootstrapping">here</a>) sets the environment
variable to the id given by the config model. This id should then be used by the
service to subscribe for config. If you are running multiple services, each
of them will be assigned a <strong>unique config id</strong> for that service, and a service
should not subscribe using any config id other than its own.
</p>

<p>
If you need to get config for a services that is not part of the model
(i.e. it is not specified in the services.xml), but that you want
specify values for in services.xml, use the config id <code>client</code>.
</p>



<h2 id="def-compatibility">Schema Compatibility Rules</h2>

<p>
A schema incompatibility occurs if the config class (for
example <code>MotdConfig</code> in the C++ and Java sections above)
was built from a different def-file than the one the server is seeing
and using to serve config. Some such incompatibilities are
automatically handled by the config system, others lead to error.
This is useful to know during development/testing of a config schema.
</p>

<p>
Let <em>S</em> denote a config definition called <em>motd</em> which
the server is using, and <em>C</em> denote a config definition also
called <em>motd</em> which the client is using, i.e. the one that
created <code>MotdConfig</code> used when subscribing. The following
is the system's behaviour:
</p>


<h3 id="compatible-changes">Compatible Changes</h3>

<p>
These schema mismatches are handled automatically by the config
server:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>C is missing a config value that S has: The server will omit
      that value from the response.</li>
  <li>C has an additional config value with a default value: The
      server will include that value in the response.</li>
  <li>C and S both have a config value, but the default values differ:
      The server will use C's default value.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="incompatible-changes">Incompatible Changes</h3>

<p>
These schema mismatches are not handled by the config server, and will
typically lead to error in the subscription API because of missing
values (though in principle some consumers of config may tolerate
them):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>C has an additional config value without a default value: The
      server will not include anything for that value.</li>
  <li>C has the type of a config value changed, for example from
      string to int: The server will print an error message, and not
      include anything for that value. The user must use an entirely
      new name for the config if such a change must be made.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="schemas-lifecycle">Schemas and a System's Life Cycle</h3>

<p>
With any data schema, it is wise to be conservative about changing it
if the system will have new versions in the future. For
a <code>def</code> schema, removing a config value constitutes a
semantic change that may lead to problems when an older version of
some config subscriber asks for config. In large deployments, the risk
associated with this increases, because of the higher cost of a full
restart of everything.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, one should prefer creating a new config name, to
removing a config value from a schema.
</p>


<h2 id="config-server">The Config Server and Object Model</h2>
<p>
Currently, the object model in the server is created from a series of
input files (<code>services.xml</code>). The model is pluggable, and
can generate config id mappings based on your own custom
syntax. See <a href="cloudconfig-model-plugins.html">Developing Cloud
Config Model plugins</a> for information on how to create model
plugins.
</p>


<h2 id="deploy">Creating a Deployable Application Package</h2>

<p>
The application package consists of the following files:
</p>

<pre>
app/services.xml
app/hosts.xml
</pre>

<p>
The services file contains the services that is handled by the config
model plugin. The hosts file contains the following:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;hosts&gt;
  &lt;host name="localhost"&gt;
    &lt;alias&gt;node0&lt;/alias&gt;
  &lt;/host&gt;
&lt;/hosts&gt;
</pre>


<h2 id="setting-up">Setting Up a Running System</h2>

<p>
To get a running system, first install the cloudconfig package, then start the config server.
</p>


<p>
Then, deploy the application:
</p>

<pre class="brush: cli">
$ deploy upload /path/to/app/folder
</pre>

<p>
Then, prepare the application:
</p>

<pre class="brush: cli">
$ deploy prepare /path/to/app/folder
</pre>

<p>
Then, make the application active
</p>

<pre class="brush: cli">
$ deploy activate /path/to/app/folder
</pre>

<p>
Then, start vespa
</p>


<p>
This will start the application and pass it its config id via the
VESPA_CONFIG_ID environment variable.
</p>



<h2 id="guidelines">Advanced Usage of the Config API</h2>
<p>
For a simple application, having only 1 config may suffice. In a
typical server application, however, the number of config settings can
become quite large.  Therefore, we <strong>encourage</strong> that you
split your config settings into multiple logical classes. This section
covers how you can use a ConfigSubscriber to subscribe to multiple
configs and how you should group configs based on their
dependencies. Configs can either be:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Independent static configs</li>
<li>Dependent static configs</li>
<li>Dependent dynamic configs</li>
</ul>

<p>
We will give a few examples of how you can cope with these different
scenarios. The code examples are given in a pseudo format common to
C++ and Java, but they should be easy to convert to their language
specific equivalents.
</p>


<h3 id="guidelines-independent">Independent Static Configs</h3>
<p>
Independent configs means that it does not matter if one of them is
updated independently of the other. In this case, you might as well
use one ConfigSubscriber for each of the configs, but it might become
tedious to check all of them. Therefore, the recommended way is to
manage all of these configs using one ConfigSubscriber. In this setup,
it is also typical to split the subscription phase from the config
check/retrieval part. The subscribing part:
</p>

<h4 id="guidelines-independent-cpp">C++</h4>
<pre class="brush: cpp">
ConfigSubscriber subscriber;
ConfigHandle&lt;FooConfig&gt;::UP fooHandle = subscriber.subscribe&lt;FooConfig&gt;(&hellip;);
ConfigHandle&lt;BarConfig&gt;::UP barHandle = subscriber.subscribe&lt;BarConfig&gt;(&hellip;);
ConfigHandle&lt;BazConfig&gt;::UP bazHandle = subscriber.subscribe&lt;BazConfig&gt;(&hellip;);
</pre>

<h4 id="guidelines-independent-java">Java</h4>
<pre class="brush: java">
ConfigSubscriber subscriber;
ConfigHandle&lt;FooConfig&gt; fooHandle = subscriber.subscribe(FooConfig.class, &hellip;);
ConfigHandle&lt;BarConfig&gt; barHandle = subscriber.subscribe(BarConfig.class, &hellip;);
ConfigHandle&lt;BazConfig&gt; bazHandle = subscriber.subscribe(BazConfig.class, &hellip;);
</pre>

<p>And the retrieval part:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
if (subscriber.nextConfig()) {
    if (fooHandle-&gt;isChanged()) {
        // Reconfigure foo
    }
    if (barHandle-&gt;isChanged()) {
        // Reconfigure bar
    }
    if (bazHandle-&gt;isChanged()) {
        // Reconfigure baz
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
This allows you to perform the config fetch part either in its own
thread or as part of some other event thread in your application.
</p>


<h3 id="guidelines-dependent-static">Dependent Static Configs</h3>
<p>
Dependent configs means that one of your configs depends on the value
in another config. The most common is that you have one config which
contains the config id to use when subscribing to the second
config. In addition, your system may need that the configs are updated
to the same <strong>generation</strong>.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
A generation is a monotonically increasing number which is increased
each time an application is deployed
with <code>deploy</code>. Certain applications may require
that all configs are of the same generation to ensure consistency,
especially container-like applications. All configs subscribed to by a
ConfigSubscriber are guaranteed to be of the same generation.
</p>

<p>
The configs are static in the sense that the config id used does not
change. The recommended way to approach this is to use a two phase
setup, where you fetch the initial configs in the first phase, and
then subscribe to both the initial and derived configs in order to
ensure that they are of the same generation. Assume that the
InitialConfig config contains two fields named derived1 and derived2:
</p>

<h4 id="guidelines-dependent-static-cpp">C++</h4>
<pre class="brush: cpp">
ConfigSubscriber initialSubscriber;
ConfigHandle&lt;InitialConfig&gt;::UP initialHandle = subscriber.subscribe&lt;InitialConfig&gt;(&hellip;);
while (!subscriber.nextConfig()); // Ensure that we actually get initial config.
std::auto_ptr&lt;InitialConfig&gt; initialConfig = initialHandle-&gt;getConfig();

ConfigSubscriber subscriber;
&hellip; = subscriber.subscribe&lt;InitialConfig&gt;(&hellip;);
&hellip; = subscriber.subscribe&lt;DerivedConfig&gt;(initialConfig-&gt;derived1);
&hellip; = subscriber.subscribe&lt;DerivedConfig&gt;(initialConfig-&gt;derived1);
</pre>

<h4 id="guidelines-dependent-static-cpp">Java</h4>
<pre class="brush: java">
ConfigSubscriber initialSubscriber;
ConfigHandle&lt;InitialConfig&gt; initialHandle = subscriber.subscribe(InitialConfig.class, &hellip;);
while (!subscriber.nextConfig()); // Ensure that we actually get initial config.
InitialConfig initialConfig = initialHandle.getConfig();

ConfigSubscriber subscriber;
&hellip; = subscriber.subscribe(InitialConfig.class, &hellip;);
&hellip; = subscriber.subscribe(DerivedConfig.class, initialConfig.derived1);
&hellip; = subscriber.subscribe(DerivedConfig.class, initialConfig.derived1);
</pre>

<p>
You can then check the configs in the same way as for independent
static configs, and be sure that all your configs are of the same
generation. The reason why you need to create a new ConfigSubscriber
is that <strong>once you have called nextConfig(), you cannot add or
remove new subscribers</strong>.
</p>


<h3 id="guidelines-dependent-dynamic">Dependent Dynamic Configs</h3>
<p>
Dynamic configs mean that the set of configs that you subscribe for
may change between each deployment. This is the hardest case to solve,
and how hard it is depends on how many levels of configs you have. The
most common one is to have a set of bootstrap configs, and another set
of configs that may change depending on the bootstrap configs
(typically in an application that has plugins). To cover this case,
you can use a class named <code>ConfigRetriever</code>. Currently it is
<strong>only available in the C++ API</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The ConfigRetriever uses the same mechanisms as the ConfigSubscriber
to ensure that you get a consistent set of configs. In addition, two
more classes called
<code>ConfigKeySet</code> and <code>ConfigSnapshot</code> are added. The
ConfigRetriever takes in a set of configs used to bootstrap the system in its
constructor. This set does not change. It then provides one method,
<code>getConfigs(ConfigKeySet)</code>.  The method returns a
ConfigSnapshot of the next generation of bootstrap configs or derived configs.
</p>

<p>
To create the ConfigRetriever, you must first populate a set of
bootstrap configs:
</p>

<pre class="brush: cpp">
ConfigKeySet bootstrapKeys;
bootstrapKeys.add&lt;BootstrapFooConfig&gt;(configId);
bootstrapKeys.add&lt;BootstrapBarConfig&gt;(configId);
</pre>

<p>
The bootstrap configs are typically configs that will always be needed
by your application. Once you have defined your set, you can create
the retriever and fetch a ConfigSnapshot of the bootstrap configs:
</p>

<pre class="brush: cpp">
ConfigRetriever retriever(bootstrapKeys);
ConfigSnapshot bootstrapConfigs = retriever.getConfigs();
</pre>

<p>
The ConfigSnapshot contains the bootstrap config, and you may use that
to fetch the individual configs. You need to provide the config id and
the type in order for the snapshot to know which config to look for:
</p>

<pre class="brush: cpp">
if (!bootstrapConfigs.empty()) {
    std::auto_ptr&lt;BootstrapFooConfig&gt; bootstrapFoo = bootstrapConfigs.getConfig&lt;BootstrapFooConfig&gt;(configId);
    std::auto_ptr&lt;BootstrapBarConfig&gt; bootstrapBar = bootstrapConfigs.getConfig&lt;BootstrapBarConfig&gt;(configId);
</pre>

<p>
The snapshot returned is empty if the retriever was unable to get the
configs.  In that case, you can try calling the same method again.
</p>

<p>
Once you have the bootstrap configs, you know the config ids for the
other components that you should subscribe for, and you can define a
new key set. Lets assume that bootstrapFoo contains an array of config
ids we should subscribe for.
</p>

<pre class="brush: cpp">
ConfigKeySet pluginKeySet;
for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; (*bootstrapFoo).pluginConfigId.size; i++) {
    pluginKeySet.add&lt;PluginConfig&gt;((*bootstrapFoo).pluginConfigId[i]);
}
</pre>

<p>
In this example we know the type of config requested, but this could
be done in another way letting the plugin add keys to the set.
</p>

<p>
Now that the derived configs have been added to the pluginKeySet, we
can request a snapshot of them:
</p>

<pre class="brush: cpp">
ConfigSnapshot pluginConfigs = retriever.getConfigs(pluginKeySet);
if (!pluginConfigs.empty()) {
    // Configure each plugin with a config picked from the snapshot.
}
</pre>

<p>
And thats it. When calling the method without any key parameters, the
snapshot returned by this method may be empty if <strong>the config
could not be fetched within the timeout</strong>, or <strong>the
generation of configs has changed</strong>. To check if you should
call getBootstrapConfigs() again, you can use the
<code>bootstrapRequired()</code> method. If it returns true, you will have to
call getBootstrapConfigs() again, because the plugin configs have been updated
and you need a new bootstrap generation to match it. If it returns false, you
may call getConfigs() again to try and get a new generation of plugin configs.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you use the retriever API if you have a use case
like this.  The alternative is to create your own mechanism using two
ConfigSubscriber classes, but this is <strong>not</strong>
recommended.
</p>

<h3 id="guidelines-tips">Advice on Config Modelling</h3>
<p>
Regardless of which of these types of configs you have, it is
recommended that you always fetch all the configs you
need <strong>before</strong> you start configuring your system. This
is because the user may deploy multiple different version of the
config that may cause your components to get conflicting config
values. A common pitfall is to treat dependent configs as independent,
thereby causing inconsistency in your application when a config update
for config A arrives before config B. The ConfigSubscriber was created
to minimize the possibility of making this mistake, by ensuring that
all of the configs comes from the same config reload.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
Tip: Setup your entire <em>tree</em> of configs in one thread to
ensure consistency, and configure your system once all of the configs
have arrived. This also maps best to the ConfigSubscriber, since it is
not thread safe.
</p>

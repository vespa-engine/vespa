<p class="ingress">
A Query Profile is a named collection of search request parameters
given in the configuration.  The search request can specify a query
profile whose parameters will be used as parameters of that
request. This relieves the client from having to manage and send a
large number of parameters, and enables the request parameters to use
for a use case to be changed without having to change the client.
Query profiles enables <em>bucket tests</em>, where a part of the
query stream is given some experimental treatment, as well as
differentiating behavior based on (OEM) customer, user type, region,
frontend type etc. This document explains how to create and use query
profiles. See also
the <a href="reference/query-profile-reference.html">the
query profile reference</a> for the full syntax.
</p>



<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>

<p>
This section describes how to create, deploy and use query
profiles.
</p>


<h2 id="creating-a-query-profile">Creating a Query Profile</h2>
<p>
A Query Profile is an XML file containing the request parameter names
and their values, for example:
</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;query-profile id=&quot;MyProfile&quot;&gt;
  &lt;field name=&quot;hits&quot;&gt;10&lt;/field&gt;
  &lt;field name=&quot;unique&quot;&gt;merchantid&lt;/field&gt;
&lt;/query-profile&gt;
</pre>

<p>
For the full syntax,
see <a href="reference/query-profile-reference.html#query-profiles">the
query profile reference</a>.  Note that full property names must be
used, aliases are only supported in requests and programmatic
lookup. See <a href="reference/search-api.html">the search
API</a> for a list of the built in query properties.
</p>


<h2 id="deploying-a-query-profile">Deploying a Query Profile</h2>
<p>
To deploy a query profile:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an XML file for the profile, containing the XML format
      above, having the name <em>[my-profile-name].xml</em>,
      e.g <em>MyProfile.xml</em> (replace any <code>/</code> in the
      name by <code>_</code>).</li>
  <li>Put this in the directory <em>search/query-profiles</em> under
      the <a href="cloudconfig/application-packages.html">application package</a>
      root directory.</li>
  <li><a href="cloudconfig/application-packages.html#deploying-a-vespa-application">redeploy</a>
      the application package.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Any number of query profile files may be added to this directory.
</p>

<p>
If the query profiles contains errors, like incorrect syntax, infite
reference loops etc., deployment will fail.
</p>


<h2 id="using-a-query-profile">Using a Query Profile</h2>

<p>
To use a query profile in a search request, send the name of the
profile as the parameter <code>queryProfile</code>:
</p>

<pre class="brush: text">
queryProfile=MyProfile
</pre>

<p>
The parameter values set in <em>MyProfile.xml</em> will then be used
as if they were present directly in the search request.
</p>

<p>
If a parameter is present both directly in the request and in a
profile, the request value takes precedence by default.  Individual
query profile field can be made to take priority by setting
the <code>overridable</code> attribute to <code>false</code>.
</p>

<p>
If the search request does not specify a query profile, the profile
named <code>default</code> will be used.  If no <code>default</code>
profile is configured, no profile will be used. If the queryProfile
parameter is set but does not resolve to an existing profile an error
message is returned.
</p>


<h2 id="looking-up-a-value-from-a-query-profile">Looking up a Value from a Query Profile</h2>
<p>
The query profile values (whether set from a configured query profile
or by the request) is available as Query properties.  To look up a
value from a Searcher component, use
</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
query.properties().get(&quot;myVariable&quot;)
</pre>

<p>
Note that property names are case sensitive.
</p>



<h1 id="query-profile-features">Query Profile Features</h1>

<p>
The following section describes the various query profile features
available in no particular order.
</p>


<h2 id ="nested-structure">Nested Structure</h2>

<p>
To support structure in the set of request variables, a query profile
value may not be a string but a reference to another query profile. In
this case, the referenced query profile functions as a map (or struct,
if types are used, see below) in the referencing query profile. The
parameter names of the nested profile gets preceded by the name of the
reference variable and a dot. For example:
</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;query-profile id=&quot;MyProfile&quot;&gt;
  &lt;field name=&quot;hits&quot;&gt;10&lt;/field&gt;
  &lt;field name=&quot;unique&quot;&gt;merchantid&lt;/field&gt;
  <strong>&lt;field name=&quot;user&quot;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MyUserProfile&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/field&gt;</strong>
&lt;/query-profile&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Where the referenced profile might look like:
</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;query-profile id=&quot;MyUserProfile&quot;&gt;
    &lt;field name=&quot;age&quot;&gt;20&lt;/field&gt;
    &lt;field name="profession"&gt;student&lt;/field&gt;
&lt;/query-profile&gt;
</pre>

<p>
If <code>MyProfile</code> is referenced in a query now, it will
contain the variables
</p>

<pre class="brush: text">
hits=10
unique=merchantid
user.age=20
user.profession=student
</pre>

<p>
Of course, references can be nested to provide a deeper structure,
producing variables having multiple dots.  The dotted variables can be
overridden directly in the search request (using the dotted name) just
as other parameters.
</p>

<p>
Note that the id value of a profile reference can also be set in the
request, making it possible to choose not just the top level profile
but also any number of specific subprofiles in the request. For
example, the request can contain
</p>

<pre class="brush: text">
queryProfile=MyUserProfile&amp;user=ref:MyOtherUserprofile
</pre>

<p>
to change the reference in the above example to some other
subprofile. Note the <code>ref:</code> prefix which is required to
identify this as setting user to a query profile referenced by id
rather than setting it to a string.
</p>


<h2 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h2>
<p>
A query profile may inherit one or more other query profiles. This is
useful when there is some common set of parameters applicable to
multiple use cases, and a smaller set of parameters which varies
between them.  To inherit another query profile, reference it as
follows:
</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;query-profile id=&quot;MyProfile&quot; <strong>inherits=&quot;MyBaseProfile&quot;</strong>&gt;
  &hellip;
&lt;/query-profile&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The parameters of <code>MyBaseProfile</code> will be present when this
profile is used exactly as if they were explicitly written in this
profile.
</p>

<p>
Multiple inheritance is supported by specifying multiple
space-separated profile ids in the inheritance attribute.  Order
matters in this list &mdash; if a parameter is set in more than one of
the inherited profiles, the first one encountered in the depth first,
left to right search order is used.
</p>

<p>
Parameters specified in the child query profile will always override
the same parameters in a inherited one.
</p>


<h2 id="value-substitution">Value Substitution</h2>

<p>
Query profile values may contain substitution strings on the form
%{property-name} which are replaced by the value returned
from <code>query.properties().get(&quot;property-name&quot;)</code> <em>at
the time of the lookup</em>.  An example:
</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;query-profile id=&quot;MyProfile&quot;&gt;
  &lt;field name=&quot;message&quot;&gt;Hello %{world}!&lt;/field&gt;
  &lt;field name=&quot;world&quot;&gt;Earth&lt;/field&gt;
&lt;/query-profile&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The value returned by looking up <code>message</code> will
be <em>Hello Earth!</em>.
</p>

<p>
As the lookups happens at query time, substituted values may be looked
up in variants, in inherited profiles, in values set at run time and
by following query profile references. Details:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>No substitution will be performed <em>in</em> values set at run
      time.</li>
  <li>If the value referenced in a substitution returns null, the
      reference is substituted by the empty string</li>
  <li>Unclosed substitutions causes an error at deploy time, but
      unknown values does not (they may exist at run time and will be
      replaced by an empty string if not).</li>
  <li>Recursive substitution works as expected. However, there is no
      loop detection.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="query-profile-variants">Query Profile Variants</h2>

<p>
In some cases, it is convenient to allow the values returned from a
query profile to vary depending on the values of some properties input
in the request. For example, a query profile may contain values which
depends on both the market in which the request originated
(<code>market</code>), the kind of device
(<code>model</code>) <em>and</em> the bucket in question
(<code>bucket</code>).
</p>

<p>
Such variants over a set of request parameters may be represented in a
single query profile, by defining nested variants of the query profile
for the relevant combinations of request values. Here is a complete
example:
</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;query-profile id=&quot;multiprofile1&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- A regular profile may define &quot;virtual&quot; children within itself --&gt;

    &lt;!-- Names of the request parameters defining the variant profiles of this. Order matters as described below.
         Each individual value looked up in this profile is resolved from the most specific matching virtual
         variant profile --&gt;
    &lt;dimensions&gt;region,model,bucket&lt;/dimensions&gt;

    &lt;!-- Values may be set in the profile itself as usual, this becomes the default values given no matching
         virtual variant provides a value for the property --&gt;
    &lt;field name=&quot;a&quot;&gt;My general a value&lt;/field&gt;

    &lt;!-- The &quot;for&quot; attribute in a child profile supplies values in order for each of the dimensions --&gt;
    &lt;query-profile for=&quot;us,nokia,test1&quot;&gt;
        &lt;field name=&quot;a&quot;&gt;My value of the combination us-nokia-test1-a&lt;/field&gt;
    &lt;/query-profile&gt;

    &lt;!-- Same as [us,*,*]  - trailing &quot;*&quot;&#x27;s may be omitted --&gt;
    &lt;query-profile for=&quot;us&quot;&gt;
        &lt;field name=&quot;a&quot;&gt;My value of the combination us-a&lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field name=&quot;b&quot;&gt;My value of the combination us-b&lt;/field&gt;
    &lt;/query-profile&gt;

    &lt;!-- Given a request which matches both the below, the one which specifies concrete values to the left
         gets precedence over those specifying concrete values to the right
         (i.e the first one gets precedence here) --&gt;
    &lt;query-profile for=&quot;us,nokia,*&quot;&gt;
        &lt;field name=&quot;a&quot;&gt;My value of the combination us-nokia-a&lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field name=&quot;b&quot;&gt;My value of the combination us-nokia-b&lt;/field&gt;
    &lt;/query-profile&gt;
    &lt;query-profile for=&quot;us,*,test1&quot;&gt;
        &lt;field name=&quot;a&quot;&gt;My value of the combination us-test1-a&lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field name=&quot;b&quot;&gt;My value of the combination us-test1-b&lt;/field&gt;
    &lt;/query-profile&gt;

&lt;/query-profile&gt;
</pre>


<h3 id="variants-and-inheritance">Variants and Inheritance</h3>
<p>
It is possible to define variants across several levels in an
inheritance hierarchy.  The variant dimensions are inherited from
parent to child, with the usual precedence rules (depth first left to
right), so a parent profile may define the dimensions and the child
the values over which it should vary.
</p>

<p>
Variant resolution within a profile has precedence over resolution in
parents. This means e.g that a default value for a given property in a
sub-profile will be chosen over a perfect variant match in an
inherited profile.
</p>

<p>
Variants may specify their own inherited profiles, as in
</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;query-profile id=&quot;multiprofile1&quot;&gt;
    &hellip;
    &lt;query-profile for=&quot;us,nokia,test1&quot; inherits=&quot;parent1 parent2&quot;&gt;
        &hellip;
    &lt;/query-profile&gt;
&lt;/query-profile&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Values are resolved in this profile and inherited profiles
&ldquo;interleaved&rdquo; by the variant resolution order (which is
specificity by default). E.g by decreasing priority:
</p>

<pre class="brush: text">
1.   Highest prioritized variant value
2.   Value in inherited from highest prioritized variant
3.   Next highest prioritized variant value
4.   Value in inherited from next highest prioritized variant
&hellip;
n.   Value defined at top level in profile
n+1. Value in inherited from query profile
</pre>


<h2 id="query-profile-types">Query Profile Types</h2>

<p>
The query profiles may optionally be <em>type checked</em>. Type
checking is turned on by referencing a <em>Query Profile Type</em>
from the query profile. The type lists the legal set of parameters of
the query profile, whether additional parameters are allowed, and so
on.
</p>

<p>
A query profile type is referenced by
</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;query-profile id=&quot;MyProfile&quot; <strong>type=&quot;MyProfileType&quot;</strong>&gt;
  &hellip;
&lt;/query-profile&gt;
</pre>

<p>
And the type is defined as:
</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;query-profile-type id=&quot;MyProfileType&quot;&gt;
  &lt;field name=&quot;age&quot; type=&quot;integer&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;field name=&quot;profession&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;field name=&quot;user&quot; type=&quot;query-profile:MyUserProfile&quot;&gt;
&lt;/query-profile-type&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This specifies that these three parameters may be present in profiles
using this type, as well as the query profile type of
the <code>user</code> parameter.
</p>

<p>
It also possible to specify that parameters are mandatory, that no
additional parameters are allowed (strict), to inherit other types and
so on, refer to the full syntax in
<a href="reference/query-profile-reference.html#query-profile-types">the
query profile reference</a>. If the base profile type is strict,
it <em>must</em> extend a built-in query profile type, see
the <a href="reference/query-profile-reference.html#strict">reference
documentation on strict</a>.
</p>

<p>
A query profile type is deployed by adding an xml file
named <em>[query-profile-type-name].xml</em> in
the <em>search/query-profiles/types</em> directory in the search
definition.
</p>

<p>
Query profile types may be useful even if query profiles are not used
to set values. As they define the names, types and structure of the
parameters which can be accepted in the search request, they can also
be used to define, restrict and check the content of search
requests. For example, as the built-in search api parameters are also
type checked if a typed query profile is used, types can be used to
restrict the parameters that can be set in a request, or to mandate
that some are always set. The built-in parameters are defined in a set
of query profile types which are always present and which can be
inherited and referenced in application-defined types. These built-in
types are defined in
the <a href="reference/search-api.html">search api</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="path-patching">Path Matching</h2>
<p>
By adding &lt;match path=&quot;true&quot;&gt; to a profile
type, <em>path</em> name matching is used rather than the default
exact matching when a profile is looked up from a name. Path matching
interprets the profile name as a slash separated path and matches
references which are subpaths (more specific paths) to
super-paths. The most specific match becomes the target of the
reference. For example:
</p>

<pre class="brush: text">
Given the query profile names

  a1
  a1/b1

then

  a1/b1/c1/d1  resolves to a1/b1
  a1/b         resolves to a1
  a            does not resolve
</pre>

<p>
This is useful to assign specific query profile id's to every client
or bucket without having to create a different configuration item for
each of these cases. If there is a need to provide a differentiated
configuration for any such client or bucket in the future, this can be
done without having the client change its request parameter because a
specific id is already used.
</p>


<h2 id="versioning">Versioning</h2>
<p>
Query profiles (and types) may exist in multiple versions at the same
time. Wherever a name of a query profile (or type) is referenced, the
name may also append a version string, separated by a colon,
e.g <code>MyProfile:1.2.3</code>. The version number
is <em>resolved</em> - if no version is given the highest version
known is used. If the version number is only partially specified, as
in <code>my-version:1</code>, the highest version starting by 1 is
used.
</p>

<p>
Where a query profile (or type) is defined, the id may specify the
version, followed by a colon:
</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;query-profile id=&quot;MyProfile<strong>:1.2.3</strong>&quot;&gt;
  &hellip;
&lt;/query-profile&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Any sub-number omitted is taken to mean 0 where a version is defined,
so <code>id=&quot;MyProfile:1&quot;</code> is the same
as <code>&quot;id=MyProfile:1.0.0&quot;</code>.
</p>

<p>
Query profiles (and types) which specifies a version in their id, must
use a file name which includes the same version string after the name,
separated by a dash, e.g <em>MyProfile-1.2.3.xml</em>.
</p>

<p>
For more information on versions,
see <a href="jdisc/component-versioning.html">component versioning</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="dump-tool">Dump Tool</h2>

<p>
It can sometimes be handy to be able to dump resolved query profiles
offline. A tool is provided for this purpose, which can be run using
</p>

<pre class="brush: cli">
$ vespa-query-profile-dump-tool
</pre>

<p>
Please run the tool with no arguments to get documentation on usage.
</p>

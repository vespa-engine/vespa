# Include metrics that match the given tags.

# A tag specification either adds a single tag by given the full tag name, or
# any tag, by specifying an asterix as wildcard ('*'). An asterix will not match
# metrics without any tags set, but you can match these by specifying an empty
# string.
#
# A metric set matched by tags, will also include every metric contained in it
# regardless of tags.

consumer[].tags[] string restart

# Do not include metrics that match the specific tags. This has higher
# presedence than the adding of tags, but lower presedence than name patterns.
#
# Removed tags are specified as added tags, with a small exception. Removing
# wildcard or untagged metrics does not make sense, as metrics are not added by 
# default. If you don not want to include these metrics, just not specify them
# as tags to be added. Thus, these are not allowed in remove tags spec.
#
# A metric set matched by remove tag will remove all metrics below that tag.
## restart flag was added automatically and needs to be verified.
consumer[].removedtags[] string restart

# Include all metrics that matches the names given here.
# Metrics added here have presedence above tag specifications.
#
# Names are specified as a complete dot separated path to metric. Asterix can
# be used to match any part. An asterix will only match a complete name without
# a dot. So if you have an average metric called 'queuesize' in your top level
# metric set called 'myapp', you can add this metric with the spec
# 'myapp.queuesize'. You can also add non-default average metric entries by
# specifying which, such as 'myapp.queuesize.last' or 'myapp.queuesize.max'.
# Patterns can be used, to for instance specify '*.queuesize', 'myapp.*', '*.*',
# 'myapp.*.max' or similar.
#
# A metric set added with specific name will add all metrics within it.
## restart flag was added automatically and needs to be verified.
consumer[].addedmetrics[] string restart

# Do not include metrics with the below names.
# This has highest presedence. Metrics removed like this will override any
# specification otherwise that would include them.
#
# The remove metrics are specified exactly the same as the added metrics.
#
# A metric set removed with specific name will remove all metrics within it.

## Whether or not the bouncer should stop external load from

stop_external_load_when_cluster_down bool default=true

## Sets what node states the node will allow incoming commands
## in.
stop_all_load_when_nodestate_not_in string default="uri"

## Sets whether to just use (self) reported node state or to use wanted state

## The maximum clock skew allowed in the system. Any messages received

## If this config value is != -1, the node will reject any external feed
## operations with a priority lower than that specified here. Note that since
## we map priorities in such a way that 0 is the _highest_ priority and 255 the
## _lowest_ priority, for two operations A and B, if B has a lower priority
## than A it will have a higher priority _integer_ value.
##
## Only mutating external feed operations will be blocked. Read-only operations
## and internal operations are always let through.
##
## Default is -1 (i.e. rejection is disabled and load is allowed through)

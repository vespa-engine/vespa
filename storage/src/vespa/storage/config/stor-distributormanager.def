## Maximum number of ideal state operations scheduled by a distributor.
maxpendingidealstateoperations int default=100

## The total size of unique documents in a bucket before we split it due to
## being too big. By default this is now 32 MB.
splitsize int default=33544432
        
## The maximum amount of entries in a file before we should attempt to split it.
## A meta data entry in a slotfile currently uses 40 bytes. It is probably
## good to have the split size, such that all meta data entries are normally
## read when you do the initial read. With the default of 1024, meta data will
## take up around 40 kB, and the default initial read is 64 kB, allowing the
## file to grow a bit above max and still all be read in initial read.
splitcount int default=1024

## The maximum size of unique documents that allows the system to reduce
## the number of split bits on the bucket, or join two buckets together.
## The size must be lower than this number, and the count must be lower than
## joincount.
joinsize int default=16000000

## The maximum number of unique documents that allows for joining (see
## joinsize).
joincount int default=512

## Minimum level of splitting for buckets
minsplitcount int default=16

## If non-empty, continuously delete all the documents matching this selection.
garbagecollection.selectiontoremove string default=""

## The interval with which each bucket is purged using the selection above.
## If 0, no garbage collection is done.
garbagecollection.interval int default=0

## If false, dont do splits inline with feeding.
inlinebucketsplitting bool default=true

## List of state checkers (ideal state generators) that should be ignored in the cluster.
## One or more of the following (case insensitive):
##
## SynchronizeAndMove
## DeleteExtraCopies
## JoinBuckets
## SplitBucket
## SplitInconsistentBuckets
## SetBucketState
## GarbageCollection
blockedstatecheckers[] string restart

## Whether or not distributor should issue reverts when operations partially
## fail.
enable_revert bool default=true

## Maximum nodes involved in a merge operation. Currently, this can not be more
## than 16 nodes due to protocol limitations. However, decreasing the max may
## be useful if 16 node merges ends up too expensive.
maximum_nodes_per_merge int default=16

## For internal in process debugging, it may be useful to not start the
## distributor thread to be able to call tick() manually and run single threaded
start_distributor_thread bool default=true restart

## The number of ticks calls done before a wait is done.  This can be
## set higher than 10 for the distributor to improve speed of bucket iterations
## while still keep CPU load low/moderate.
ticks_before_wait int default=10

## The sleep time between ticks if there are no more queued tasks.
ticks_wait_time_ms int default=1

## Max processing time used by deadlock detector.
max_process_time_ms int default=5000

## Allow overriding default priorities of certain maintenance operations.
## This is an advanced feature, do not touch this unless you have a very good
## reason to do so! Configuring these values wrongly may cause starvation of
## important operations, leading to unpredictable behavior and/or data loss.
##
## Merge used to move data to ideal location
priority_merge_move_to_ideal_node int default=165

## Merge for copies that have gotten out of sync with each other
priority_merge_out_of_sync_copies int default=120

## Merge for restoring redundancy of copies
priority_merge_too_few_copies int default=120

## Copy activation when there are no other active copies (likely causing
## lack of search coverage for that bucket)
priority_activate_no_existing_active int default=100

## Copy activation when there is already an active copy for the bucket.
priority_activate_with_existing_active int default=100

## Deletion of bucket copy. Cheap on VDS, not necessarily so on indexed search.
priority_delete_bucket_copy int default=100

## Joining caused by bucket siblings getting sufficiently small to fit into a
## single bucket.
priority_join_buckets int default=155

## Splitting caused by system increasing its minimum distribution bit count.
priority_split_distribution_bits int default=200

## Splitting due to bucket exceeding max document count or byte size (see
## splitcount and splitsize config values)
priority_split_large_bucket int default=175

## Splitting due to buckets being inconsistently split. Should be higher
## priority than the vast majority of external load.
priority_split_inconsistent_bucket int default=110

## Background garbage collection. Should be lower priority than external load
## and other ideal state operations (aside from perhaps minimum bit splitting).
priority_garbage_collection int default=200

## The distributor can send joins that "lift" a bucket without any siblings
## higher up in the bucket tree hierarchy. The assumption is that if this
## is done for all sibling-less buckets, they will all eventually reach a
## level in the tree where they do in fact have a sibling and may (if their
## sizes allow) be joined into a single bucket.
enable_join_for_sibling_less_buckets bool default=false

## There exists a distribution edge case where bucket siblings end up having
## non-equal ideal locations. This will normally inhibit join operations, as
## these are only allowed when all nodes have all source buckets involved in
## the join operation. Setting this property to true means such buckets may
## still be joined at the cost of transient inconsistencies for the buckets
## being joined into.
enable_inconsistent_join bool default=false

## The distributor host info reporter may be disabled entirely, in which case
## no per-node statistics for merges, latencies or bucket replication factors
## will be reported back to the cluster controller. Disabling this may make
## sense in large clusters that do not make use of these reports directly or
## indirectly, as it causes potentially significant processing overhead on the
## cluster controller.
## This host reporter must never be disabled on a Hosted Vespa system, or
## automatic upgrades will stall.
enable_host_info_reporting bool default=true

## For each available node, the distributor will report back to the cluster
## controller a value which indicates the minimum replication factor for any
## bucket contained on said node. This config exposes a way to alter how this
## replication factor is computed.
##
## Valid enum values and their semantics:
##
## TRUSTED - only trusted replicas are counted.
## ANY - any replica present is counted. This may return an overly optimistic
##       view of the system. E.g. if there are 3 replicas, 1 having 1000 docs
##       and 2 having 1 doc, all being out of sync, counting with ANY will still
##       treat this as a minimum replication factor of 3. Conversely, with
##       TRUSTED such a bucket would most likely have a factor of 0 (or 1 iff
##       the trusted status for the replica with 1000 docs is known).
minimum_replica_counting_mode enum { TRUSTED, ANY } default=TRUSTED

## Bucket activation only makes sense for indexed search clusters, but Proton
## may also be run in store-only or streaming mode, in which case it does not
## actually require any activations. If the model infers that Proton is running
## in such a mode, activation will be explicitly disabled.
##
## Activation is always disabled entirely for clusters using VDS as their
## engine, regardless of the value of this setting.
disable_bucket_activation bool default=false


## Maximum clock skew across nodes in the cluster, in whole seconds.
## Used to prevent timestamp collisions during distributor bucket ownership
## transfers.
## Zero means this mechanism is disabled.
max_cluster_clock_skew_sec int default=1

## If set, a distributor will only allow one active operation per document ID
## for puts, updates and removes. This helps prevent issues caused by concurrent
## modifications to documents when sent from multiple feed clients.
sequence_mutating_operations bool default=true

## Number of seconds that scheduling of new merge operations should be inhibited
## towards a node if it has indicated that its merge queues are full or it is
## suffering from resource exhaustion.
inhibit_merge_sending_on_busy_node_duration_sec int default=10

The JDisc Container is the home of all application specific plug-ins in Vespa.
It can also be used to build standalone server applications, but in Vespa it is
the basis of the search container and document processing. As the <em>Search
Container</em>, it handles all incoming queries, and returns results. As the
<em>Document Processor Container</em>, all documents fed passes through it. In
both cases, this allows plug-ins to process or modify all queries, results and
documents globally.
</p>

<p>
The JDisc Container has also been known as the Middleware Container
(MWC for short). The <em>Search Container</em>, where all global
processing of user actions (represented as queries) and their results
is done, is also known as QRS. When hosting document processors, the
JDisc Container is sometimes called docproc for short, though this may
also refer to a single document processor, or the cluster of document
processing nodes.
</p>

<p>
The JDisc Container provides a development and hosting environment for
processing <em>components</em>, and a model for composing such components
developed by multiple development teams into a functional whole. The goal is to
allow query, result and document processing to grow to great levels of
sophistication by providing a strong component model including isolation, while
still providing great development ergonomics to allow developers to experiment
with new functionality.
</p>

<p>
The main features of the JDisc Container are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>An <a href="../jdisc/developing-osgi-bundles.html">OSGi</a> based component model which
    allows deployment and undeployment of components to a cluster of running
    instances, as well as isolation and controlled sharing of classes between
    components</li>
<li>A general model of Documents, Queries, Results and the
    components processing them</li>
<li>A composition mechanism – <em><a
    href="../jdisc/chained-components.html">chains</a></em> – for building applications
    from components and managing the execution order dependencies</li>
</ul>

<p>
The JDisc Container comes bundled with a framework
for <em>federating</em> applications – the
<a href="../federation-platform.html">federation platform</a>.  It is run
by all the <strong>JDisc nodes</strong> in a Vespa installation.
</p>



<h1 id="plugins">Plug-ins</h1>

<p>
The plug-ins in a container may be a general component, just using
the OSGi integration of the container to deploy arbitrary application
specific components, or it may be one of the types of components
defined by Vespa itself.  The plug-ins used by Vespa are <em><a
 href="searcher-development.html">searchers</a></em>, <em><a
 href="docproc-development.html">document processors</a></em>
(<em>docprocs</em>), <em>handlers</em> and <em><a
 href="result-rendering.html">renderers</a></em>. Searchers are result
and query processors. Document processors transform or analyse all
documents fed to Vespa. Handlers are used to handle user requests
which should not be processed directly by any searcher, e.g. building
web services which then generate searches. Renderers are used to render
result pages when responding to a request; renderers supersede
templates which were used in earlier versions of Vespa.
</p>

<p>
Searchers and document processors are executed in chains. A query is passed from
searcher to searcher in a chain. The searchers are executed in a synchronous
fashion, each taking ownership of the query passed to them. Searcher order is in
other words execution order, a searcher which is before some other searchers,
gets the query before these searchers. Since the result is returned through the
same chain, a searcher early in the chain, will be late to access the result.
Document processor chains do not return any kind of results, they only pass on
the processed documents to the next component.
</p>

<p>
All kinds of components are usually deployed as OSGi bundles in the Vespa
application package.

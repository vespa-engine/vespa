This is the reference for the semantic rule language in Vespa.  For a
guide on using this language,
see <a href="../query-rewriting.html">query rewriting</a>.
</p>



<h1 id="rule-bases">Rule bases</h1>

<p>
Semantic rules are collected in files called <em>rule bases</em>. The
name of these files are <em>[rule-base-name].sr</em> They must be
placed in <em>[application-package]/rules/</em> to be deployed.
</p>



<h1 id="basic-syntax">Basic syntax</h1>

<p>
A rule base may contain any number of the following four constructs,
explained in the rest of this document:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#directives">directives</a></li>
  <li><a href="#production_rules">production rules</a></li>
  <li><a href="#named_conditions">named conditions</a></li>
  <li>comments, starting by # and ending by newline.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Production rules and named conditions are <em>statements</em>.
Statements may span multiple lines and are terminated
by <code>;</code>.
</p>



<h1 id="directives">Directives</h1>

<p>
A directive is a &ldquo;meta-level&rdquo; statement which is not used
during rule evaluation, but tells the rule engine how to use the rule
base. A statement starts by <code>@</code> and ends by newline. They
may take parameters. These directives exists:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Statement</th><th>Usage</th><th>Location</th></tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>@default</td>
      <td>Make this rule base the default, to be used with all queries</td>
      <td>Anywhere outside other statements</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>@automata(&lt;automata-filename&gt;)</td>
      <td>Use an automata file with this base</td>
      <td>Anywhere outside other statements</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>@include(&lt;rulebase-name&gt;)</td>
      <td>Include all the statements of another rule base in this</td>
      <td>Anywhere outside other statements</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>@super</td>
      <td>Include the conditions of the same-named conditions from the included rule base</td>
      <td>In a condition</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<h1 id="production-rules">Production Rules</h1>

<p>
A production rule is of the form
</p>

<pre class="brush: text">
<a href="#conditions">&lt;condition&gt;</a> &lt;operator&gt; <a href="#production_list">&lt;production-list&gt;</a>;
</pre>

<p>
This performs the production as defined by the operator if the
condition matches.  There are two kinds of production rules (and two
operators), replacing and adding:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Rule kind</th>
      <th>Operator</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Replacing</td>
      <td>-&gt;</td>
      <td><em>Replace</em> the matched terms by the production</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Adding</td>
      <td>+&gt;</td>
      <td><em>Add</em> the production to the matched terms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<h1 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h1>

<p>
A namespace is a collection of facts which can be read from conditions
and changed by productions.  Namespaces may be positional (sequences),
or not. A positional namespace will track the current fact and match
and insert at the current position, while non-positional namespaces
will match any fact against any condition.
</p>

<p>
There is a default namespace which does not need an explicit
reference.  For query rules, the default namespace is the query
terms.
</p>

<p>
To determine the namespace used to read from conditions or change in
productions, use
</p>

<pre class="brush: text">
&lt;namespace&gt;.<a href="#conditions">&lt;condition&gt;</a>
&lt;namespace&gt;.<a href="#production">&lt;production&gt;</a>
</pre>

<p>
There are two namespaces defined during query processing:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Namespace</th>
      <th>Syntax</th>
      <th>Positional</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Query</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>The default namespace. References the terms of the
          query. The condition value returned will be the term
          itself.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Parameter</td>
      <td><code>parameter.</code></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>References the parameter of the query.  Conditions will be
          true if the parameter is set in the query.  The value
          returned from conditions is the value of the parameter.
          Productions will need both a key and value specified to set
          a parameter value.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<h1 id="named-conditions">Named Conditions</h1>

<p>
A named condition is on the form
</p>

<pre class="brush: text">
[condition-name] :- <a href="#conditions">&lt;condition&gt;</a>;
</pre>

<p>
This simply assigns a name to the condition on the right, so it can be
referred to the conditions in rules and other named conditions.
</p>


<h1 id="conditions">Conditions</h1>

<p>
A condition is an expression which evaluates to true or false over
the <em>facts</em> of a <a href="#namespaces">namespace</a>.  If the
namespace is <em>positional</em> (a <em>sequence</em>) evaluation
starts at the <em>current position</em> in the namespace.  When
evaluated true, conditions will also return a value which can be
referenced by comparison conditions.
</p>

<p>
Conditions may be preceded by a reference name and a label:
</p>

<pre class="brush: text">
(<a href="#reference-name">&lt;reference-name&gt;</a>/)?(<a href="#condition-label">&lt;label&gt;</a>:)?<a href="#condition">&lt;condition&gt;</a>
</pre>


<h2 id="reference-name">Reference Name</h2>

<p>
The reference name allow an explicit name to be set from which the
terms matched by the condition can be referred in a condition. This is
useful when multiple conditions of the same type are used in the
condition of the same rule.
</p>

<p>
If no reference name is given, the text standing between the square
brackets of the condition is used as reference name.
</p>


<h2 id="condition-label">Label</h2>

<p>
If a label is specified, the condition will only match terms having
that label (the label is the index in query terms).  If a label is not
set, the term will match if a label is not set, or if it is
<code>default</code>.
</p>


<h2 id="condition">Condition</h2>

<p>
These are the supported kinds of conditions:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Condition</th>
      <th>Syntax</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
      <th>Returned value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Term</td>
      <td>&lt;term&gt;</td>
      <td>True if this is the term at the current position</td>
      <td>Determined by the <a href="#namespaces">namespace</a></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Reference</td>
      <td>[&lt;condition-name&gt;]</td>
      <td>Evaluate a named condition</td>
      <td>The matched term(s)</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Sequence</td>
      <td>&lt;condition&gt; &lt;condition&gt;</td>
      <td>Match both conditions by consecutive terms in the right order in the sequence</td>
      <td>The last nested condition value</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Choice</td>
      <td>&lt;condition&gt;, &lt;condition&gt;</td>
      <td>Match any one of the conditions, each one tried at the current position</td>
      <td>The last nested condition value</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Group</td>
      <td>(&lt;condition&gt;)</td>
      <td>Evaluate the condition inside the grouping as a unit</td>
      <td>The last nested condition value</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Ellipsis</td>
      <td>&hellip;</td>
      <td>Matches any sequence to make the overall condition match</td>
      <td>The matched sequence</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Referable ellipsis</td>
      <td>[&hellip;]</td>
      <td>An ellipsis where the matched sequence can be referenced from the production</td>
      <td>The matched sequence</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Not</td>
      <td>!&lt;condition&gt;</td>
      <td>Matches if the condition does not match</td>
      <td>Nothing</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>And</td>
      <td>&lt;condition&gt; &amp; &lt;condition&gt;</td>
      <td>Matches if all the conditions matches at the (same) current position</td>
      <td>The last nested condition value</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Comparison</td>
      <td>&lt;condition&gt; <a href="#operator">&lt;operator&gt;</a> &lt;condition&gt;</td>
      <td>True if the comparison is true for the values returned from the conditions</td>
      <td>The last nested condition value</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Literal</td>
      <td>'&lt;literal&gt;'</td>
      <td>Returns a value for comparison. This always evaluates to true.</td>
      <td>The literal value</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Start anchor</td>
      <td>. &lt;condition&gt;</td>
      <td>Matches condition only if it matches the query from the start</td>
      <td>The matched sequence</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>End anchor</td>
      <td>&lt;condition&gt; .</td>
      <td>Matches condition only if it matches the query to the end</td>
      <td>The matched sequence</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


<h2 id="operator">Comparison Condition Operators</h2>

<p>
The possible operators of a comparison condition are
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Operator</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr><td>=</td><td>Left and right values are equal</td></tr>
    <tr><td>&lt;=</td><td>Left value is smaller or equal</td></tr>
    <tr><td>&gt;=</td><td>Left value is larger or equal</td></tr>
    <tr><td>&lt;</td><td>Left value is smaller</td></tr>
    <tr><td>&gt;</td><td>Left value is larger</td></tr>
    <tr><td>=~</td><td>Left value contains right value as a substring</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<h1 id="production-list">Production List</h1>

<p>
A production list consists of a space-separated list
of <em>productions</em> which are carried out when the production of a
rule is matched.  A production can be preceded by the type of term to
produce, a label (index in queries), and followed by the weight
(importance) of the produced value:
</p>

<pre class="brush: text">
(<a href="#term-type">&lt;term-type&gt;</a>)?(<a href="#production-label">&lt;label&gt;</a>:)?<a href="#production">&lt;production&gt;</a>(!<a href="#weight">&lt;weight&gt;</a>)?
</pre>


<h2 id="term-type">Term Type</h2>

<p>
The default term type is the term type of the context which the term
is added to.  The possible explicit term types are
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Syntax</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
    </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr><td>?</td><td>Insert as an OR term</td></tr>
    <tr><td>+</td><td>Insert as an AND term</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$</td><td>Insert as a value (RANK) term</td></tr>
    <tr><td>-</td><td>Insert as a NOT term</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


<h2 id="production-label">Label</h2>
<p>
If included, the label decides the label the produced term(s) will
have in the namespace. This is the index in the query namespace.
</p>


<h2 id="production">Production</h2>
<p>
There are three types of productions:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Production</th><th>Syntax</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Literal term</td>
      <td>&lt;term&gt;</td>
      <td>Produce this term literally</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Literal term with value</td>
      <td>&lt;term&gt;='&lt;value&gt;'</td>
      <td>Produce this term and value literally.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Reference</td>
      <td>[&lt;condition-reference&gt;]</td>
      <td>Produce the terms matched by the referenced condition. The
        reference name is either the name of a named condition used in
        the condition, an
        ellipsis&mdash;<code>&hellip;</code>&mdash;or an explicit
        condition reference name.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>
<p>
The weight is a percentage integer denoting the importance of the
produced term. The default is 100.  In the query namespace the weight
becomes the term weight, determining the relevance contribution of the
term.

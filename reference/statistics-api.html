<p class="ingress">
This document describes how to use the statistics module in Vespa and
includes an example QRS plugin which uses the statistics module.
</p>

<p>
The goal of the statistics module is making it possible to gather
measurements of a component with minimal effort. Collected data are
logged at given intervals.
</p>

<p>Processing and logging is done in the background by the library,
measurements are sent to the library by Handle instances. A client
obtains and initializes a (subclass of) Handle, then collects data using that
handle.
</p>

<p>Events are registered by name. If two events are registered using the same
name, the last one registered will be used.
</p>

<p>All statistics objects are thread-safe.</p>


<h1>Writing a plugin using statistics</h1>

<p>Using the statistics library is supposed to be as non-intrusive in
code as possible. Sampling a value is supposed to be cheap. It is necessary
to supply a Statistics manager into a handle during construction, the
manager instance is acquired through dependency injection in the container.
</p>

<h2>Example searcher</h2>

<pre class="code">
package com.yahoo.example;

import com.yahoo.search.Query;
import com.yahoo.search.Result;
import com.yahoo.search.searchchain.Execution;
import com.yahoo.prelude.query.*;
import com.yahoo.statistics.Value;
import com.yahoo.statistics.HistogramType;
import com.yahoo.statistics.Statistics;
import java.util.Iterator;

public class QueryDepthSearcher extends <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/search/Searcher.html">Searcher</a> {

    private final <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/statistics/Value.html">Value</a> queryDepth;

    public QueryDepthSearcher(<a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/statistics/Statistics.html">Statistics</a> manager) {
        // Initialize new statistics value handle:
        // - the event name is "query_depth"
        // - Do not read config
        // - Do use a histogram split at 0.0, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0
        // - Use a regular histogram, not some sort of cumulative histogram
        queryDepth = new Value("query_depth", manager,
                new <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/statistics/Value.Parameters.html">Value.Parameters</a>()
                        .setLogHistogram(true)
                        .setLimits(new <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/statistics/Limits.html">Limits</a>(new double[] { 0, 1, 2, 3 })
                        .setHistogramId(<a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/statistics/HistogramType.html">HistogramType</a>.REGULAR)
                        // Do log mean value pr logging interval
                        .setLogMean(true)
                        // Log mean with the name "query_depth", not "query_depth.mean"
                        .setNameExtension(false)));
    }

    @Override
    public Result search(Query query, Execution execution) {
        int depth = stackDepth(0, query.getModel().getQueryTree().getRoot());
        queryDepth.put(depth);

        return execution.search(query);
    }

    /**
     * Helper function to find depth of query trees. Just to have
     * something to sample.
     */
    private int stackDepth(int i, Item root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return i;
        }
        if (root instanceof CompositeItem) {
            int maxDepth = i;
            for (Iterator&lt;Item&gt; j = ((CompositeItem) root).getItemIterator();
                    j.hasNext();) {
                int newDepth = stackDepth(i+1, j.next());
                maxDepth = Math.max(maxDepth, newDepth);
            }
            return maxDepth;
        } else {
            return i;
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Above is a complete QRS plugin. The only thing it does is sample the
depth of the query tree, and logging the mean depth along with a histogram
for the depths.
</p>

<p>Do note that it may very often be cleaner get the parameters for a Value or
Counter instance from your own <a href="#custom_config">custom configuration
classes</a> than by overriding the contents of the statistics configuration.
I.e. simply read the desired values from the custom configuration, and
initialize the Value (or other class) using a standard constructor ignoring
configuration. </p>


<h1>The Value Class</h1>

<p>The <a
href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/statistics/Value.html">Value</a>
class is a Handle subclass which represents sampled values which will
fluctuate, as contradistinguished from monotone growth, over time. The
values may be handled as raw values which the surrounding code simply
sets to some appropriate level, or a bucket that the surrounding code
fills with samples – for which derived values, such as the mean
value, is logged.
</p>

<p>The default behavior is logging nothing. Everything emitted
to the log must be stated in the Value.Parameters instance or
config.</p>

<p>A Value instance can be initialized with a set of limits to split
a histogram for the samples. In other words, using the limits { 0,
1, 2 } will lead to the histogram having four buckets, covering
the intervals { &lt;-∞, 0&gt;, [0, 1&gt;, [1, 2&gt;, [2, ∞&gt; }. Samples
put into the Value instance will be counted in the correct bucket
automatically, and the histogram will be sent to the log and reset
for each logging interval.
</p>

<p>Apart from the raw/last value sampled and a histogram for the value
distribution, the minimum, maximum and mean value can be logged.
</p>

<p>Value instances use the log events <em>value</em> and <em>histogram</em>.
</p>



<h1>The Counter class</h1>

<p>The <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/statistics/Counter.html">Counter</a> class is a  subclass of Handle which represents integer
values increasing either over the lifetime of a process, or for each
logging interval. A Counter may be incremented by 1, or by an
arbitrary integer.
</p>

<h3>ResetCounter</h3>

<p>A counter may be reset between each logging interval. It is then
output to the log as a <em>value</em> event instead of a count. This
is chosen either by using a constructor argument or using
config.
</p>

<p>Counter events use the log events <em>count</em> and <em>value</em>.
</p>



<h1>The ValueGroup class</h1>

<p>A <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/statistics/ValueGroup.html">ValueGroup</a> represents a set of associated Value instances.  Each time
a variable is sampled, the name of the Value in question is passed
to the ValueGroup along with the new sample.
</p>

<p>A ValueGroup only supports
logging the raw value, not derived statistics (histogram, min, etc). In
the log, the name for each value will be
<em>nameOfValueGroup.nameOfValue</em>.
</p>

<p>A ValueGroup is marginally more expensive than a Value, since each
sample is a Map lookup to find the correct Value instance.
</p>



<h1>The CounterGroup class</h1>

<p>A <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/statistics/CounterGroup.html">CounterGroup</a> represents a set of associated Counter instances. Each
time a Counter for a CounterGroup is incremented, the name of the
Counter in question is passed to the CounterGroup along with the
increment.
</p>

<p>A CounterGroup is marginally more expensive than a Counter, since each
sample is a Map lookup to find the correct Counter instance.
</p>



<h1>Callbacks</h1>

<p>It is sometimes useful to do some processing right before data is dumped to
log, or simply only then perform measurements. The statistics library supports
this by having a callback slot in all objects used when collecting data. The
callback is called immediately <em>before</em> the object logs its values. As the
callback is run in the worker thread of the statistics library, a callback
must be lightweight.</p>


<h2>Callback example</h2>

<p>This is a code snippet which obtains the number of currently running
worker threads.
</p>

<pre class="code">
  <em>[&hellip;]</em>

private final Value activeQueries; // raw measure every 5 minutes

// Callback to measure queries in flight every five minutes
private static class ActivitySampler implements <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/statistics/Callback.html">Callback</a> {
  public void run(Handle h, boolean firstRun) {
        if (firstRun) {
            // don't insert a value, ensure counter is reset at reconfig
            return;
        }
        // Sample the current number of currently active queries
        // in progress in the QRS.
        ((<a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/statistics/Value.html">Value</a>) h).put(Server.get().searchQueriesInFlight());
  }
}

public StatisticsSearcher(<a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/statistics/Statistics.html">Statistics</a> manager) {
  activeQueries = new <a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/statistics/Value.html">Value</a>("active_queries", manager,
          new Value.Parameters().setLogRaw(true)
                  .setCallback(new ActivitySampler()));

  <em>[&hellip;]</em>
</pre>


<p>First a Value instance is obtained, then a callback is inserted, and
the value is ready for use. The callback will be activated automatically
every 5 minutes (or every configured <em>n</em> minutes).
</p>

<p>The <a
href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/statistics/Callback.html">Callback</a>
interface defines two arguments which are passed to the implementing object. The
<a href="../javadoc/index.html?com/yahoo/statistics/Handle.html">Handle</a> argument
is the statistics handle which called the callback, typically a Value or Counter
owning the callback object. The second, the boolean, is set to true the first
time, and only the first time, a callback is called from the given handle. The
reason for adding this information is in case the callback emits a log event to
the log itself (even though that would be unusual) and the first emitted value
should be a well-defined special case, e.g. a hard-coded zero value.</p>


<h1>Configuring statistics components</h1>

<p>Statistics events can be configured either using custom config classes
in conjunction with programmatic setup, or overriding global arrays. For
most cases, using custom config classes is desirable.</p>

<a name="custom_config"></a>
<h2>Custom config classes</h2>

<p>Using custom configuration classes has two huge advantages over overriding
values in the global configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is easier to maintain small, specifically modelled custom config classes
than the contents of a very general array in the configuration.</li>
<li>By using custom config classes, fewer components have to be re-initialized
during reconfiguration. A very large number of components depend on Statistics,
changing some global statistics configuration, will force all these instances to
be constructed once more. Changing a configuration only used a single place,
will only lead to that component (and any dependants) being reconstructed.</li>
</ul>


<p>Assume a searcher plugin which tracks the number of hits returned each
logging interval, and optionally tracks the mean (number of hits returned).
First, one would create config definition as outlined in the documentation for
general <a
href="../jdisc/container-components.html#configurable_components">configurable
components</a>, the configuration definition might look as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
namespace=example

## Switch to control whether to log mean number of hits per query
logmean bool default=false
</pre>

<p>Then, we need a search which actually does the measurements, and also
reads the configuration:</p>

<pre class="code">
package com.yahoo.example;

import com.yahoo.example.HitratesConfig;
import com.yahoo.search.Query;
import com.yahoo.search.Result;
import com.yahoo.search.Searcher;
import com.yahoo.search.searchchain.Execution;
import com.yahoo.statistics.Statistics;
import com.yahoo.statistics.Value;

/**
 * An example searcher measuring the total number of documents fetched each
 * logging interval, and optionally the mean number of documents per query.
 */
public class HitratesMeasurer extends Searcher {
    private final Value <em>rates</em>;

    public HitratesMeasurer(final Statistics manager,
            final HitratesConfig <strong>config</strong>) {
        // Create a Value object which always logs the sum, but whether the mean
        // is to be logged, is fetched from config. Activate name extension to
        // allow for multiple values being logged, using a suffix to distinguish
        // them.
        <em>rates</em> = new Value("hit_rates", manager, new Value.Parameters()
                .setNameExtension(true).setLogSum(true)
                .setLogMean(<strong>config.logmean()</strong>));
    }

    @Override
    public Result search(final Query query, final Execution execution) {
        final Result result = execution.search(query);
        // Measure the number of documents returned to the user
        <em>rates.put(result.getConcreteHitCount())</em>;
        return result;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>It is then possible to turn logging of the mean event on and off, without
having to maintain the entire control array in the statistics configuration.</p>

<h2>Using the global configuration</h2>

<p>In general, one should usually employ smaller custom configuration classes
as described above. If a single part of the global statistics config changes,
all components emitting statistics events have to be constructed once more,
making reconfiguration very expensive. Also, maintaining the arrays inside
the global configuration is very cumbersome, compared to changing specific
structures inside custom configuration classes.</p>

<p>Below follows a version of the config definition for the
statistics library. This can be found in
<code>$VESPA_HOME/var/db/vespa/config_server/serverdb/classes/statistics.2.def</code>
file.
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;config name="container.statistics"&gt;
&lt;!-- Interval between internal sample points measured in minutes --&gt;
&lt;collectionintervalsec&gt;5&lt;/collectionintervalsec&gt;

&lt;!-- Interval between each dump to log measured in minutes --&gt;
&lt;loggingintervalsec&gt;5&lt;/loggingintervalsec&gt;

&lt;!-- Configuration for measured values --&gt;
&lt;values index="0"&gt;
  &lt;!-- A string which uniquely identifies the event in the log --&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;example_event&lt;/name&gt;

  &lt;!-- An array of what operations should be performed on gathered data --&gt;
  &lt;operations index="0"&gt;
    &lt;!-- An enum with the name of the operation to perform in the event. Legal
         values RAW, MEAN, MIN, MAX, REGULAR, CUMULATIVE, REVERSE_CUMULATIVE.
         --&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;RAW&lt;/name&gt;

    &lt;!-- Arguments for the operations, typically limits for arrays. --&gt;
    &lt;arguments index="0"&gt;
      &lt;key&gt;some_string&lt;/key&gt;
      &lt;value&gt;some_string&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/arguments&gt;
  &lt;/operations&gt;
&lt;/values&gt;

&lt;!-- The counters which should be reset between each collection interval,
and therefore be logged as values. --&gt;
&lt;counterresets index="0"&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;name_of_count_to_reset&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;/counterresets&gt;
&lt;/config&gt;
</pre>

<p>Reconfiguring a component is done by adding the config tag with the name
<code>statistics</code> to the apropriate component in
<code>services.xml</code>. The following example shows how to change the
measurement and logging intervals to get measurements each minute from all
qrservers:</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;!-- other config&hellip; --&gt;
&lt;jdisc&gt;
  &lt;search&gt;
    &lt;config name="container.statistics"&gt;
      &lt;collectionintervalsec&gt;1&lt;/collectionintervalsec&gt;
      &lt;loggingintervalsec&gt;1&lt;/loggingintervalsec&gt;
    &lt;/config&gt;
    &lt;!-- other config&hellip; --&gt;
  &lt;/search&gt;
&lt;!-- other config&hellip; --&gt;
&lt;/jdisc&gt;
</pre>

<p>This is the complete content of <code>statistics.cfg</code> when the
only desired change is getting the statistics events every minute. Obviously
this will only affect components using this library.</p>



<h1>Logging intervals</h1>

<p>Data is dumped to log every <em>n</em> minutes. The first logging event is
scheduled as soon as possible, but at <em>m×n</em> minutes after 1970-00-00
00:00, where <em>m</em> is an integer and leap seconds are ignored. The
default value of <em>n</em> is 5, leading to data being logged 0, 5, 10,
15, 20, &hellip; minutes past each hour.
</p>


<h2>Reconfiguring logging intervals</h2>

<p>At the time of writing, <code>collectionintervalsec</code> has to be set
equal to <code>loggingintervalsec</code>, as there currently is no internal
extra data aggregation. So, to make all containers log events every minute,
the following example in <code>services.xml</code> should do the trick:

<pre class="code">
&lt;!-- other config&hellip; --&gt;
&lt;jdisc&gt;
  &lt;config name="container.statistics"&gt;
    &lt;collectionintervalsec&gt;1&lt;/collectionintervalsec&gt;
    &lt;loggingintervalsec&gt;1&lt;/loggingintervalsec&gt;
  &lt;/config&gt;
   &lt;!-- other config&hellip; --&gt;
&lt;/jdisc&gt;
&lt;!-- other config&hellip; --&gt;
</pre>


<h2>Deactivating event logging</h2>

The one exception to the rule of logging interval always being equal to the
collection interval is when deactivating all events, this is done by setting
<code>loggingintervalsec</code> to 0. So, to e.g. deactivate all event logging from
docproc, something like the following would be appropriate:</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;docproc version="3.0"&gt;
  &lt;config name="container.statistics"&gt;
    &lt;loggingintervalsec&gt;0&lt;/loggingintervalsec&gt;
  &lt;/config&gt;
&lt;!-- other config&hellip; --&gt;
&lt;/docproc&gt;
</pre>

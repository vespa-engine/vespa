The config inspect interface has been made to make it easy to see
which configs are used by the application which uses the cloudconfig
library.
</p>

<p>
Here we will describe the way an application must expose the required
config meta data, so the automated utilities can give you a full
system overview.
</p>

<p>
The config meta data must be available over HTTP. The content type of
the data returned from the application must be JSON in the format
given in the example below. The request path used to retrieve the
information is: <code>/state/v1/config</code>.
</p>

<p>
Each component within your application which subscribes to a config
must be visible in the output. The only required field is the config
generation returned by the subscriber. An optional message field can
also be added in case some config values requires a restart to take
effect.
</p>



<h2 id="example">JSON Example</h2>

<pre class="code">
{
  &quot;config&quot;: {
    &quot;component1&quot;: {
      &quot;generation&quot;: 2
    },
    &quot;component2&quot;: {
      &quot;generation&quot;: 2,
      &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Restart required for all config values to take effect&quot;
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The component name used should identify part of the application the
config is used in. And the generation number must be the number for
the config that is active in the application.
</p>

<p>
What we want to capture with this system is to see the main switch for
the application config. So if you have one major config and some small
less important ones, onyl the toplevel major config is really
needed. It allows us to see the glitch between activating a new
configuration and it being applied to the application and to see if
something went horribly wrong by it not being applied at all.

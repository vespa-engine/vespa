# The LLM model to use
model model

# Maximum number of requests to handle in parallel pr container node
parallelRequests int default=1

# Additional number of requests to put in queue for processing before starting to reject new requests
maxQueueSize int default=10

# Use GPU
useGpu bool default=true

# Maximum number of model layers to run on GPU
gpuLayers int default=1000000

# Number of threads to use for CPU processing - -1 means use all available cores
# Not used for GPU processing
threads int default=-1

# Context size for the model
# Context is divided between parallel requests. So for 10 parallel requests, each "slot" gets 1/10 of the context
contextSize int default=4096

# Maximum number of tokens to process in one request - overriden by inference parameters
maxTokens int default=512

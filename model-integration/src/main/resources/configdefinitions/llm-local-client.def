# The LLM model to use
model model

# Maximum number of requests to handle in parallel pr container node
parallelRequests int default=1

# Additional number of requests to put in queue for processing before starting to reject new requests
maxQueueSize int default=100

# Max number of milliseconds to wait in the queue before rejecting a request
maxQueueWait int default=10000

# Max number of milliseconds to wait for adding a request to the queue before rejecting it
# This only applies for when using synchronous processing.
# Asynchronous processing will reject a request immediately if the queue is full.
maxEnqueueWait int default=10000

# Use GPU
useGpu bool default=true

# Maximum number of model layers to run on GPU
gpuLayers int default=1000000

# Number of threads to use for CPU processing - -1 means use all available cores
# Not used for GPU processing
threads int default=-1

# Context size for the model
# Context is divided between parallel requests. So for 10 parallel requests, each "slot" gets 1/10 of the context
contextSize int default=4096

# Maximum number of tokens to generate in one request - can be overridden by inference parameters
maxTokens int default=512

# Specifies number of tokens to truncate prompts to, should be > 0.
# 0 or less means that prompts will not be truncated.  
# To avoid context overflow: maxPromptTokens + maxTokens <= contextSize / parallelRequests
maxPromptTokens int default = 0

# Specifies what to do when the number of tokens in a prompt + maxTokens > contextSize / parallelRequests.
# NONE - run inference no matter context and prompt sizes.
# In this case, newer tokens overwrite older ones and the model looses part of the prompt. 
# It might lead to nonsense completions and performance issues.
# DISCARD - silently discard the request - don't run inference
# ABORT - discard the request and raise an error
contextOverflowPolicy enum {NONE, DISCARD, ABORT} default=NONE

# Random number generator seed used by LLM runtime during inference.
# It can be used for better reproducibility of LLM completions.
# Still, it doesn't guarantee reproducibility, especially on different hardware.
# -1 means no specific seed will be set.

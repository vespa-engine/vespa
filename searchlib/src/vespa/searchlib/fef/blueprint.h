 * A blueprint is a description of a named feature executor with a
 * given set of parameters that also acts as a factory for that
 * feature executor. During setup, the blueprint will look at the
 * parameters and generate a list of input feature names and also name
 * and describe its outputs. A blueprint will be created per rank
 * setup and used to create feature executors per query. A single
 * instance is used as a prototype to create actual blueprints used by
 * the framework. The prototype instance will also get a chance to
 * name features that should be dumped when doing a full feature dump
 * (feature dumps are used for things like MLR training). It will be
 * possible to define additional dump features in the config.

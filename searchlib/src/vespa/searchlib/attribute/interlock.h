 *
 * Threads T1, T2: Grouping queries
 * Threads T3, T4: Attribute writer threads
 *
 * Thread T1 gets shared lock on A1
 * Thread T2 gets shared lock on A2
 * Theead T3 tries to get exclusive lock on A1
 * Theead T4 tries to get exclusive lock on A2
 * Thread T1 tries to get shared lock on A2
 * Thread T2 tries to get shared lock on A1
 *
 * With the interlock properly used, thread T3 will hold the
 * interlock, preventing thread T4 from registering intent to get
 * write lock on A2, thus thread T1 can get a shared lock on A2 and complete.

title: "Developing Cloud Config Model Plugins"
---

<p>
The Cloud Config System (CCS) provides the ability to write custom
plugins to the config model. This allows cloud config consumers to
provide a custom syntax for their users to configure the system.
</p>



<h1 id="why">Why Create a Plugin</h1>
<p>
While creating a config model plugin is not strictly necessary for
using CCS, it increases the usability of your platform. With a plugin,
you can provide custom syntax that allows the users to configure the
system at a higher level of abstraction.
</p>


<h2 id="problem">What problem does it solve</h2>
<p>
Imagine that you are developing a platform that requires the user to configure
a cluster of servers running some service that can potentially scale to hundreds
of servers. A service may be composed of multiple processes running on the same
server, and those processes might be containers running many components inside
them. The amount of configuration parameters of those processes and components
can be huge. Very often, the differences in the configurations might be small,
but just enough that you need to duplicate information that you later on need to
ensure that does not conflict.
</p>
<p>
Once you have this large amount of configuration parameters, the logical step is
to create some sort of script that automatically generates a valid configuration
based on a few parameters to reduce the amount of human errors. It is also
common to create some form of validation program that can be run to ensure that
the configuration options are valid and does not conflict. CCS model plugins
allows you to take this even further.
</p>
<p>
In CCS, the configuration is represented as an application package, which
contains various files that can represent the entire system configuration.
However, the configuration is not directly given to the consumer processes and
their components. First, the application package is provided as input to the
config server, which builds a java object model of the system, also known as the
<i>config model</i>. The config model is built from a set of <i>model plugins</i>
that are able to produce a java object model based on the application package
contents. The object model can then serve the appropriate configuration to a
component within a service.
</p>

<h3 id="sowhat">So whats so great about having plugins?</h3>
<p>
The model plugins allows you to create abstractions on top of the low level
configuration parameters that are given to the services. Here are some specific
use cases the model plugins solve:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The application can be validated to ensure that there are no syntax
errors in the configuration files.</li>
<li>The configuration files can be checked for conflicting configuration
values</li>
<li>The plugin can allocate resources without the user needing to specify them
(typically server ports)</li>
<li>The plugin may support any form of syntax as long as it can generate the
object model, though using XML allows you to take advantage of many existing
library features that i.e. make node and port allocation automatic or to allow
the service to be automatically bootstrapped.</li>
<li>The plugin may provide a high level of abstraction that allows the user to
change one configuration value, while in reality more than one of the
configuration values served to the services may change.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="pluginexample">Example</h3>
<p>
Vespa uses CCS with multiple config model plugins. In Vespa, you can set up a complete system with e.g this configuration:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;services version="1.0"&gt;

  &lt;admin version="2.0"&gt;
    &lt;adminserver hostalias="node1"/&gt;
  &lt;/admin&gt;

  &lt;jdisc id="stateless" version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;nodes&gt;
      &lt;node hostalias="node2"/&gt;
    &lt;/nodes&gt;
    &lt;search/&gt;
  &lt;/jdisc&gt;

  &lt;content id="mycontent" version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;redundancy&gt;2&lt;/redundancy&gt;
    &lt;documents&gt;
      &lt;document type="myschema" mode="index"/&gt;
    &lt;/documents&gt;
    &lt;nodes&gt;
      &lt;node distribution-key=&#39;0&#39; hostalias=&#39;node3&#39;/&gt;
    &lt;/nodes&gt;
  &lt;/content&gt;

&lt;/services&gt;
</pre>
<p>The Vespa model plugins ensure that the following is set up based on the above XML:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A config server cluster</li>
  <li>A log server cluster receiving logs from all the nodes</li>
  <li>A service location broker cluster (slobrok) which maintains the current observed state of all the nodes in the other clusters</li>
  <li>A document processing cluster processing incoming data</li>
  <li>A JDisc cluster set up to receive searches</li>
  <li>A dispatch cluster doing scatter-gather</li>
  <li>A cluster controller cluster which takes singular decisions about the current state of nodes in the content cluster</li>
  <li>A distributor cluster managing content distribution</li>
  <li>A search+content cluster storing and searching a partition</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition it sets up the wiring between these clusters, the matching
configuration of content and query processing etc. etc. , all told a number of
instances of over hundred configuration types.
</p>
<p>
Going from the simple user-facing config shown above to this complete system
specification is the task of the config model(s).
</p>
<p>
Technically the models are just Java objects that are instantiated in response
to hitting a tag immediately below &lt;services&gt; in <em>services.xml</em> (so the
above will create one <em>admin</em>, <em>container</em> and <em>content</em> model), which are
embedded into the config server at runtime and answers incoming requests for
config instances.  During construction of the complete system model (consisting
of multiple such config models), the models may create additional implicit
config models and exchange information between themselves.  They may also read
other files of any format from the application package.
</p>



<h1 id="developing">Building a Model</h1>
<p>
In this section, we will build a plugin for a simple echo service.
First, we must have a config to serve. An echo server just needs to
know which port it must listen to. To keep the initial example simple,
we ignore bootstrap and which host the node should run on for now
(see <a href="#bootstrap">bootstrapping services</a> for an extended
example). The following config is created and stored in
<code>src/main/resources/configdefinitions</code> in your plugin source tree:
</p>
<pre class="brush: text">
namespace=echo
port int
</pre>
<p>
See <a href="configapi-dev.html">Using the Cloud config API</a> and
the <a href="../reference/config-files.html">Configuration File
Reference</a> for more information on config definition files.
The service will be configured using:
</p>
<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;services version="1.0"&gt;
  &lt;echo version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;port&gt;1337&lt;/port&gt;
  &lt;/echo&gt;
&lt;/services&gt;
</pre>
<p>
To deal with your custom syntax, you first need to create a
parser. The parser class must
extend <code>ConfigModelBuilder</code>. The builder is required to
specify which XML tags it can handle via
the <code>handlesElements</code> method, and must hook the model into
a subclass of <code>ConfigModel</code> object in
the <code>doBuild</code> method. Its constructor must forward the class of the
model in order for the superclass to instantiate the correct class and pass it
to doBuild:
</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
public class EchoModelBuilder extends ConfigModelBuilder&lt;EchoModel&gt; {
    public EchoModelBuilder() {
        super(EchoModel.class);
    }
    @Override
    public List&lt;ConfigModelId&gt; handlesElements() {
        return Arrays.asList(ConfigModelId.fromName("echo"));
    }
    @Override
    public void doBuild(EchoModel configModel, Element spec, ConfigModelContext modelContext) {
        int port = Integer.parseInt(XML.getValue(XML.getChild(spec, "port")));
        configModel.addServer(new EchoServer(configModel.getConfigProducer(), port));
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The config model represents the model that serves config when requested. The
<code>ConfigModel</code> object does not itself serve config, but is
used to proxy request to the appropriate config producers for that
model. For the echo service, the model is very simple:
</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
public class EchoModel extends ConfigModel {
    private final List&lt;EchoServer&gt; servers = new ArrayList&lt;EchoServer&gt;();
    public EchoModel(ConfigModelContext modelContext) {
        super(modelContext);
    }
    public void addServer(EchoServer server) {
        servers.add(server);
    }
    public int numServers() {
        return servers.size();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>EchoServer</code> is the actual object producing the config,
and is a subclass of the <code>AbstractConfigProducer</code> class,
which automatically hooks it into the parent node in the tree, and
causes config requests to be relayed to this producer:
</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
public class EchoServer extends AbstractConfigProducer implements EchoConfig.Producer {
    private final int port;
    public EchoServer(AbstractConfigProducer parent, int port) {
        super(parent, "server");
        this.port = port;
    }
    public void getConfig(EchoConfig.Builder builder) {
        builder.port(port);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>EchoConfig</code> class is the one generated from the config
definition file we specified earlier.
</p>
<p>
Now we have a complete plugin that is able to serve
the <code>echo</code> config to anyone who asks with the
appropriate <em>config id</em>. The config id of a config producer
is relative to its parent. In this example, the root producers has the
id <code>echo</code>, while the server has the id
<code>echo/server</code>.
</p>



<h1 id="dependencies">Depending on other models</h1>
<p>
To create a modular system and facilitate code reuse, it is possible to depend
on and use other models when building your own model. For instance, if we have a
<code>EchoProxyModel</code> that handled a <code>&lt;echoproxy&gt;</code> tag,
and which is dependent on the <code>EchoModel</code> being built first, we can
add it as a constructor argument to signal the dependency and also allow us to
access the <code>EchoModel</code> when building the <code>EchoProxyModel</code>.
</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
public class EchoProxyModel extends ConfigModel {
    public EchoProxyModel(ConfigModelContext context, EchoModel echoModel) {
        // Store away model for use in builder.
    }
}
</pre>



<h1 id="testing">Unit Testing</h1>
<p>
Creating a unit test for your plugin is easy. Mock classes
acting as the config model is available can can be used in your unit
tests for top level testing:
</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
public class EchoModelTest {
    @Test
    public void testEchoModel() {
        EchoModelBuilder builder = new EchoModelBuilder();
        assertThat(builder.handlesElements().size(), is(1));
        assertThat(builder.handlesElements().get(0).getName(), is("echo"));
        String xml = "&lt;echo version="1.0"&gt;"
                   + "&lt;port&gt;1337&lt;/port&gt;"
                   + "&lt;/echo&gt;"
        TestDriver testDriver = new TestDriver().addBuilder(builder);
        TestRoot root = testDriver.buildModel(xml);
        EchoConfig config = root.getConfig(EchoConfig.class, "server");
        assertThat(config.port(), is(1337));

        EchoModel model = testDriver.getConfigModels(EchoModel.class).get(0);
        assertThat(model.numServers(), is(1));
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>ConfigModelTester</code> is a helper class designed to make unit
testing config model builders a breeze. Any builders required to parse your xml
is added to the tester using the <code>addBuilder</code> method. To build the
entire model, with all dependencies resolved, call <code>buildModel</code> with
either <em>services.xml</em> or an <code>ApplicationPackage</code> as input. The
result is a <code>TestRoot</code> object which can be used to inspect the entire
model. The config retrieved from the <code>TestRoot</code> is the same as you
would get from the config server in a production system.
</p>
<p>
The MockRoot class mocks the config model producer tree, and can be
used to retrieve the config once the producers have been added to the
tree. Before using it, however, the topology must be frozen by calling
<code>freezeModelTopology</code>.
</p>
<p>
It is worth noting that on a running system, you can use the
<code>getvespaconfig</code> tool to retrieve in the payload format as well:
</p>
<pre class="brush: cli">
$ getvespaconfig -n echo.echo -i echo/server -a path/to/echo.def
</pre>



<h1 id="helper">Bootstrapping Services</h1>
<p>
To ease the bootstrapping of services that must be run, we provide
helper classes that help defining which hosts a service should run on,
and which performs automatic start/stop of those services based on the
config. We will now extend the echo service to support specifying
clusters of echo servers that are automatically bootstrapped and run
on multiple nodes.
</p>
<p>
In CCS, the term <em>node</em> is used about any machine capable of
running the services. It can be an alias for physical host, a VM or
(in the future) simply a set of parameters describing the resource
demands, and CCS will simply acquire a node for you. In this example,
we will use the traditional host alias specification.
</p>
<p>
First, the XML syntax must be changed in order to support the new
requirements and for the helper classes to recognize them:
</p>
<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;services version="1.0"&gt;
  &lt;echo version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;server hostalias="node0" port="1234" /&gt;
    &lt;server hostalias="node0" port="1235" /&gt;
    &lt;server hostalias="node1" port="1234" /&gt;
  &lt;/echo&gt;
&lt;/services&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This syntax basically says &ldquo;Run two echoservers on node0 using
port 1337 and 1338 respectively. Run one echoserver on node1 using
port 1337&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
Now we need to change the plugin (only shows methods that we have
changed):
</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
public class EchoModelBuilder extends ConfigModelBuilder&lt;EchoModel&gt; {
    &hellip;
    @Override
    public void doBuild(EchoModel configModel, Element spec, ConfigModelContext modelContext) {
        configModel.setCluster(new EchoServerClusterBuilder().build(configModel.getConfigProducer(), spec));
    }
    &hellip;
}
</pre>
<pre class="brush: java">
public class EchoModel extends ConfigModel {
    private EchoServerCluster cluster;
    public EchoModel(ConfigModelContext modelContext) {
        super(modelContext);
    }
    public void setCluster(EchoServerCluster cluster) {
        this.cluster = cluster;
    }
}
</pre>
<pre class="brush: java">
public class EchoServerClusterBuilder extends DomConfigProducerBuilder&lt;EchoServerCluster&gt; {
    @Override
    protected EchoServerCluster doBuild(AbstractConfigProducer ancestor, Element producerSpec) {
        final Element repeatElement = XML.getChild(producerSpec, "repeat");
        final int repeat = repeatElement != null ? Integer.parseInt(XML.getValue(repeatElement)) : -1;

        final EchoServerCluster cluster = new EchoServerCluster(ancestor, "echocluster", repeat);
        for (Element server : XML.getChildren(producerSpec, "server")) {
            EchoServerBuilder builder = new EchoServerBuilder(cluster.numServers());
            cluster.addServer(builder.build(cluster, server));
        }
        return cluster;
    }
}
</pre>
<pre class="brush: java">
public class EchoServerCluster extends AbstractConfigProducer implements EchoConfig.Producer {
    private final List&lt;EchoServer&gt; echoServers = new ArrayList&lt;EchoServer&gt;();
    private final int repeat;
    public EchoServerCluster(AbstractConfigProducer parent, String subId, int repeat) {
        super(parent, subId);
        this.repeat = repeat;
    }
    public void addServer(EchoServer server) {
        echoServers.add(server);
    }
    public int numServers() {
        return echoServers.size();
    }
    @Override
    public void getConfig(EchoConfig.Builder builder) {
        if (repeat &gt;= 0)
            builder.repeat(repeat);
    }
}
</pre>
<pre class="brush: java">
public class EchoServerBuilder extends DomConfigProducerBuilder&lt;EchoServer&gt; {
    private final int serverNumber;
    public EchoServerBuilder(int serverNumber) {
        this.serverNumber = serverNumber;
    }
    @Override
    protected EchoServer doBuild(AbstractConfigProducer parent, Element element) {
        int port = Integer.valueOf(element.getAttribute("port"));
        return new EchoServer(parent, "server." + serverNumber, port);
    }
}
</pre>
<pre class="brush: java">
public class EchoServer extends AbstractService implements EchoConfig.Producer {
    private final int port;
    public EchoServer(AbstractConfigProducer parent, String name, int port) {
        super(parent, name);
        this.port = port;
    }
    @Override
    public String getStartupCommand() {
        return "/mydir/bin/echoserver";
    }
    public void getConfig(EchoConfig.Builder builder) {
        builder.port(port);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
By using the helper classes, there is a minimal amount of extra code,
but the gain is huge. Using CCS, all the echoservers will
automatically start when
Vespa is run on their respective nodes, and they
will get their appropriate config id passed as an environment variable. See <a
href="configapi-dev.html">Using the Cloud config API</a> for examples of how the
echo server can subscribe and use the config.
</p>
<p>
In addition to host management,
the <code>DomConfigProducerBuilder</code> class supports parsing
config overrides as well.
</p>



<h1 id="installing">Installing model plugins</h1>
<p>
To make use of the model plugins, they must be installed on the configserver host
before the config server is started. The default folder for model plugins is
<code>$VESPA_HOME/lib/jars/config-models</code>.
</p>
<p>
Having installed the model plugin, the configserver needs to be instructed
to load the plugin. To load our example <code>EchoModelBuilder</code>, simply
add the following to <code>$VESPA_HOME/conf/configserver-app/config-models/echomodel.xml</code>
</p>
<pre class="brush: xml">
&lt;components&gt;
  &lt;component id="&lt;package&gt;.EchoModelBuilder" bundle="&lt;bundlename&gt;" /&gt;
&lt;/components&gt;
</pre>

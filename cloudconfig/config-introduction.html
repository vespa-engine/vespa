<p>
This document gives an overview of the Cloud Config System (CCS)
The problem of configuring cloud nodes can be divided into three
parts, each addressed by different solutions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Node system level configuration:</strong> Configure OS
  level settings such as time zone as well as user privileges on the
  node.</li>
  <li><strong>Package management</strong>: Ensure that the correct
  set of software packages is installed on the nodes. This
  functionality is provided by three tools working together.</li>
  <li><strong>Cloud configuration:</strong> Starts the configured
  set of processes on each node with their configured startup
  parameters and provides dynamic configuration to the modules run by
  these services.<em>Configuration</em> here is any data which
    <ul>
       <li> Can not be fixed at compile time.</li>
       <li> Is static most of the time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that by these definitions we may allow all the cloud nodes to
have the same software packages (disregarding version differences,
discussed later) because variations in what services are run on each
node and in their behavior can be achieved entirely by using CCS. This
allows us to manage the complexity of node variations completely
within the cloud configuration system rather than across multiple
systems.
</p>
<p>
CCS makes the following assumptions about the nodes using it:
</p>
<ul>
   <li> Each node has the software packages needed to run the
   configuration system and any services which will be configured to
   run on the node. This usually means that all nodes have the same
   software, although this is not a requirement.</li>
   <li> Each node has set <a href="../setting-vespa-variables.html">VESPA_CONFIGSERVERS</a>
     listing the active configuration servers.</li>
   <li>Each node knows its fully qualified domain name.</li>
</ul>



<h1 id="configuration">Cloud Configuration</h1>
<p>
The responsibility of configuring a system can be divided into two largely
independent parts
</p>
<ul>
   <li> <strong>Configuration delivery:</strong> Definition of
   individual configurations, API's for requesting and accessing
   configuration, and the mechanism for delivering configurations from
   their source to the receiving components.</li>
   <li> <strong>Configuration assembly:</strong> Assembly of a complete
   set of configurations for delivery from the inputs provided by the
   parties involved in configuring the system. </li>
 </ul>
<p> 
This division allows the problem of reliable configuration delivery in
large distributed systems to be addressed in configuration delivery
while the complexities of assembling complete configurations in the
cloud environment can be treated as a vm-local design problem.
</p>
<p>  
An important feature of CCS is the nature of the interface between the delivery
and assembly subsystems. The assembly subsystem creates as output a (Java)
object model of the desired distributed system. The delivery subsystem queries
this model to obtain concrete configurations of all the components of the
system. This allows the assembly subsystem to accept higher level and simpler to
use abstractions as input and automatically derive detailed configurations with
the correct interdependencies. This division insulates the external interface
and the components being configured from changes in each other. In addition the
system model provides the home for logic implementing node/component instance
variations of configuration.
</p>
<p> 
The next two sections will discuss the delivery and assembly
subsystems separately.
</p>



<h2 id="delivery">Configuration Delivery</h2>
<p>
Configuration delivery encompasses the following aspects:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Definition of configurations</li>
  <li> The component view (API) of configuration</li>
  <li> Configuration delivery mechanism</li>
</ul>
<p>     
These aspects work together to realize the following goals:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Eliminate inconsistency between code and configuration.</li>
  <li> Eliminate inconsistency between the desired configuration and
   the state on each node.</li>
  <li> Limit temporal inconsistencies after reconfiguration.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The next three subsections discusses the three aspects above, followed
by subsections on two special concerns - bootstrapping and system
upgrades.
</p>


<h3 id="config-definitions">Configuration Definitions</h3>
<p>
A <em>configuration</em> is a set of simple or array key-values with a
name and a type which can possibly be nested. For example:
</p>
   
<pre>
myProperty &quot;myvalue&quot;
myArray[1]
myArray[0].key1 &quot;someValue&quot;
myArray[0].key2 1337 
</pre>

<p>   
The <em>type definition</em> (or class) of a configuration object
defines and documents the set of fields a configuration may contain
with their types and default values. It has a name as well as a
namespace. For example, the above config instance may have this
definition:
</p>
   
<pre>
namespace=foo.bar

# Documentation of this key
myProperty string default=&quot;foo&quot;

# etc.
myArray[].key1 string
myArray[].key2 int default=0
</pre>

<p>
An individual config typically contains a coherent set of settings
regarding some topic, such as "logging" or "indexing". A complete
system consists of many instances of many config types.
</p>


<h3 id="component-view">The Component View of Configuration</h3>
<p>
Individual components of a system consumes one or more such configs and
use their values to influence their behavior.  APIs are needed for
<em>requesting</em> configs and for <em>accessing</em> the values of
those configs as they are provided.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Access</strong> to configs happens through a (Java or C++) class
generated from the config definition file. This ensures that any
inconsistency between the fields declared in a config type and the
expectations of the code accessing it are caught at compile time. The
config definition is best viewed as another class with an alternative
form of source syntax belonging to the components consuming it. A
Maven target is provided for generating such classes from config
definition types.
</p>
<p>   
Components may use two different methods for
<strong>requesting</strong> configurations (only Java code is shown,
here see the <a href="configapi-dev-cpp.html">Developing with the C++
Config API</a> doc for how to do this in C++):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    <strong>Subscription:</strong> The component sets up
    <em>ConfigSubscriber</em>, then subscribes to one or more
    configs. This is the simple approach, there
    are <a href="configapi-dev-java.html">other ways of</a> getting
    configs too.
    </p>
<pre>
ConfigSubscriber subscriber = new ConfigSubscriber();
ConfigHandle&lt;MydConfig&gt; handle = subscriber.subscribe(MyConfig.class, &quot;myId&quot;); 
if (!subscriber.nextConfig()) throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Config timed out.&quot;);
if (handle.isChanged()) {
  String message = handle.getConfig().myKey();
  # &hellip;consume the rest of this config
}
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  <strong>Dependency injection:</strong> The component declares its
  config dependencies in the constructor and subscriptions are set up
  on its behalf. When changed configs are available a new instance of
  the component is created. The advantage of this method is that
  configs are immutable throughout the lifetime of the component such
  that no thread coordination is required. This method is currently
  only available in Java using the jdisc container.
  </p>
<pre>
public MyComponent(MyConfig config) {
  String myKey = config.myKey();
  # &hellip;consume the rest of this config
}
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For unit testing <a
href="configapi-dev-java.html#unit-testing">configs can be created
with Builders</a>, submitted directly to components.
</p>


<h3 id="delivery-mechanism">Config Delivery Mechanism</h3>
<p>
The config delivery mechanism is responsible for ensuring that a new
config instance is delivered to each subscribing component in a timely
fashion each time there is a change to the system model causing that
config instance to change. A config subscription is identified by two
parameters, the config definition name and namespace and the config id
used to identify the particular component instance making the
subscription. The in-process config library will forward these
subscription requests to a node local config proxy which provides
caching and fan-in from processes to node. The proxy in turn issues
these subscriptions to a node in the configuration server cluster,
each of which hosts a copy of the system model and resolves config
requests by querying the system model. To provide config server
failover the config subscriptions are implemented as long-timeout gets
which are immediately resent when they time out, but conceptually this
is best understood as push subscriptions.
</p>

<p>
As configs are not stored as files locally on the nodes there is no
possibility of inconsistencies due to local edits, or of nodes coming
out of maintenance with a stale configuration.  As configuration
changes are pushed as soon as the config server cluster allows, time
inconsistencies during reconfigurations are minimized, although not
avoided as there is no global transaction.
</p>


<h3 id="bootstrapping">Bootstrapping</h3>
<p>
Until now we have described systems in their steady state, but how do
a set of processes, hosting a set of components, each initiating
subscriptions using their own unique config id's come to be? This is
the bootstrapping process.
</p>
<p>
At the outset, a single <em>sentinel</em> process is started on all nodes.
This process gets the config server names from <a href="../setting-vespa-variables.html">
VESPA_CONFIGSERVERS</a> and issues a subscription
for a process list config using the host name as the config id. This
config lists the processes to be started on the node along with the
config id to assign to each, typically the logical name of that
service instance. Those processes can then in turn instantiate
internal components, each assigned the same or another config id, and
instantiating further components, etc. This cascade of events brings
the system into steady state from an initial state where all nodes are
the same and only knows the names of the config servers.
</p>


<h3 id="upgrades">System upgrades</h3>
<p>
The configuration server will up/downgrade between config versions on
the fly on minor upgrades which causes discrepancies between the
config definitions requested from those produced by the
configuration model. Major upgrades which involve incompatible changes
to the configuration protocol or the system model, however, requires a
special procedure. A configured node can be
<strong>detached</strong> from the configuration system. On detachment,
the node will stop listening to the config server and instead keep
serving its current config from its local snapshot. To avoid losing
the snapshot on restart, the proxy will save the config snapshot on
disk during detachment.
</p>
<p>
With this operation available, the procedure goes as follows: Detach
all nodes, upgrade the config server and reassemble its
configuration. Upgrade and reattach the configured nodes one by one.
</p>



<h2 id="configuration-assembly">Configuration Assembly</h2>
<p>
Config assembly is the process of turning the configuration input
sources into an object model of the desired system which can respond
to queries for configs given a name and config id. Config
assembly for cloud systems can become complex, because it involves
merging information owned by multiple parties into a coherent whole:
</p>
<ul>
   <li> <strong>Cloud operations</strong> own the machines on the
   cloud and controls assignment of nodes to
   services/applications.</li>
   <li> <strong>Cloud service providers</strong> own services which
   hosts multiple applications running on the cloud.</li>
   <li> <strong>Cloud applications</strong> define the final
   applications running on cloud nodes and shared services.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The current config model assembly procedure uses a single source
- the <strong>application package</strong>. The application package, owned by the
application, is a directory structure containing some defined files
and sub-directories which together completely defines the system -
including which nodes belong in the system, which services they should
run and the configuration of these services and their components. When
the application deployer wants to change the application, a <strong>deploy</strong>
command is issued to a config server, with the application package as
argument.
</p>
<p>
At this point the system model is assembled and validated
and any feedback is issued to the deployer. If the deployer decides to
make the new configuration active a <strong>commit</strong> command is then issued,
causing the config server cluster to switch to the new system model
and respond with new configs on any active subscriptions where the new
system model caused the config to change. This ensures that
subscribers gets new configs timely on changes, and that the changes
propagated are the minimal set such that small changes to an
application package causes correspondingly small changes to the
system.
</p>
<img src="img/VespaAssemblySmaller.png" alt="VespaAssemblySmaller.png" />
<p>
The config model itself is pluggable, so that cloud service providers may write
plugins for assembling a particular service. The plugins are written in Java,
and is installed together with the CCS. Service plugins define their own syntax
for specifying services that may be configured by cloud applications. This
allows the applications to be specified in an abstract manner, decoupled from
the configuration that is delivered to the components.
